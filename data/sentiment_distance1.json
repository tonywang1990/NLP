        "text": "The Talimena Scenic Drive is a 50 mile drive along the ridge of the Winding Stair Mountains. In late October and early November the drive offers some of the best fall foliage in the south. Year round, the drive has RV and primitive camping, day use picnic areas, and a scenic turn-out almost every mile.For the more active, the Ouachita National Rereation Trail offers 225 miles of \"easy to moderate\" hiking between Talimena State Park in Oklahoma to Pinnacle Mountain State Park just west of Little Rock, Arkansas. Trailhead parking and primitive campsites are located about seven miles apart in the section of trail that follows the ridge of the Winding Stair Mountians. There is a $3 fee to camp, but you have free access to the showers in the adjoining RV parks. If you want to \"loop\" back to your car, you can take the equestrain trails down through the Holson Valley.Plan a stop at the Queen Wilhelmina State Park atop Rich Mountain in Arkansas. Just east of the Okla/Ark state line, this park has something for every member to your family or group. In addition to RV and tent camping, the lodge and restaurant offer food and accommodations, there are many children's activities, and several easy nature trails. Both the senic drive and the Ouachita Trail pass through this park. Reservations may be needed in the summer or fall. Call (800) 264-2477.Don't overlook this section of the country. You'll have to get off the d... interstate, and it may \"cost\" you a day, but it will be well worth it. After taking the drive, you may want to enjoy the local lakes, museums, and other attractions in the area. ",

Speed limit is 35 MPH so you can enjoy the scenery. If you are in a rush, don\u2019t take this route. Just before Lead is a new attraction called Presidents\u2019 Park. It is a self guided 6 block walking tour, or you can rent mountain bikes to go farther. Stone carvings of 43 Presidents, costs about $8 person. On to Deadwood. What a fun place to walk around on another self-guided tour! Allow at least 3 hours to see town [free], Mt Moriah Cemetary [$1 per person] and visit some casinos and have lunch. There are staged shoot-outs on the Main Street at 2pm. We ate lunch at the Iron Horse. My husband chose all day breakfast, I had grilled chicken salad [$15 USD with tax & tip] . Friendly staff, good food. At Mt Moriah we saw graves of Wild Bill Hickock, Calmity Jane, and Potato Johnny. 3 Eights and 2 Aces was the hand Wild Bill was holding when he was shot by the dirty scoundrel Jack McCall. On to Hill City to shop at the Quilt Corral of Mistletoe Ranch. Very friendly and helpful staff and wonderful selection of fabrics. We opted to stay on Hwy 16 [no park fee] rather than take the Needles Highway through Custer State Park [$5 person]. Hwy 16 has the pigtail bridges and the 3 tunnels, with Mt Rushmore framed in the exit of the last tunnel. Be aware that there is a lot of braking, tight, winding curves and narrow roads. Great scenery, saw buffalo, deer, mountain goats. Mt Rushmore [$8 parking fee] is very impressive. As you walk toward the mountain you pass thru the Avenue of Flags, every state and territory is represented. The town of Keystone is very, very commercialized. We opted to overnight in Rapid City.",

You spend about 1/2 hr each on the guided tour of the first 2 houses, see first floors only. & about 1 hr at the Old house, where you go thru 1st & 2nd floor of the 3 stories, plus the Library building. Take your pictures outside when you can, because they move you along rather quickly to the next tour or next trolley. The history alone in these houses, makes it worth while to vist all 3.

While you are in the area, you could check out the Corvette museum and assembly plant in nearby Bowling Green.

Switzers, 20 minutes outside La Canada, provides a beautiful streamside walk, and a waterfall view, and stays cool even on hot summer days. The trail on the east side of JPL up the Arroyo is terrific. Be sure to purchase a Forest Adventure Pass for parking (available at Sport Chalet in La Canada and elsewhere). The park is laced with fire roads that are perfect for mountain biking, as well as hiking trails and backpacking camps. For overnight camping, drive an hour from La Canada out Angeles Crest.

Recommendation, get there early so you can secure a good, covered picnic area as you need it, the Sun is brutal. Set-up camp and attached the ceremonial kite to the car (flys all day by itself as there is a constant light wind....). Had lunch, kids sledded and over all, we just had a wonderful day at WSNP.

        "text": "We have visited Mammoth Cave several times over the years, and the kids are finally old enough for one of the longer tours. The Grand Avenue Tour is a 4 1/2 hr tour that winds through a large section of the cave. It is rated as difficult, and if you have trouble walking up and down steep slopes, this may not be for you. The kids (8 and 13) had no trouble with the walking. There are frequent stops for narrative from the guide, so a reasonably fit person will have no trouble with the tour. The steps were easy compared to the occasionally steep and slippery slopes. 90% of the tour is through tubes formed by the river long ago. You will see large rooms, narrow canyons, wide tubes, and a few tight squeezes between rocks. It can get a bit monotonous since all the rocks look about the same. It is a dry cave, so other than the Frozen Niagra at the very end of the tour, you will not see the stalagtites and other formations that are plentiful in a wet cave (like Diamond Caverns). The guide was informative with a lot of talk about the geology and history of the cave. You eat lunch around 1 hour into the tour. The box lunch of a ham or turkey sandwhich, chips, apple, cup of vegetable soup, and drink is $7.50. They also have PB&J. The food was unremarkable, but hey, you're eating in a cave. Tour size was around 70 people, so don't expect any enroute commentary unless you are right behind the guide. This is a good tour for people who have an interest in cave geology and would like a nice walk, but you can see many of the more interesting features of the cave on shorter, less expensive tours.",

We then toured the grounds which were well kept. It might be a tough walk in the heat and humidity of summer, but it wasn't too bad the morning we were there. The grounds contain a working farm with animals and actors who are dressed for the time period. One thing that was a little disappointing was the cabin that Lincoln built with his father is not there (anymore). However, there is an outline on the ground of where it stood. I know it has been a long time since Lincoln lived there, but it would have been neat to see the cabin. This, like many other attractions in the area, is isolated and is a little bit of a drive off the Interstate, but it is a good look at the early life of our 16th President.",

Although a lot of the cave looks very similar, there are plenty of unique items throughout the cave that make the tour worthwhile. Two things to remember: 1) Its only 50 degrees F in the cave all the time, so wear pants and a jacket. 2) Call ahead to book your tickets. Only 30 people can go down per tour, so they sell out quick. If you arrive on a busy day, expect to wait several hours. There also is not a place to eat anywhere around here, so you may want to factor that in as well.

At $2 per vehicle, you can't beat the price and it provided a couple hours of fun and history for our family. We didn't see any snakes, but there were signs warning you to beware.

From Texas to New Mexico we had to take a different route itself in order to go to this place but in the end few extra hours were well worth it.

The reason is a lake nearby, however a 45 minute drive surrounded by large expanse of such pretty pious whiteness is a great and unique experience in itself. Definitely worth visiting with hardly 3$ cost per person. Maybe go early in the morning and you could feel it to be your own territory with no crowd and can get picturesque photos too.",

From the spectacular Carsbad Caverns to sophisticated Santa Fe; from the 9000 foot shops at Cloudcroft to the cliff dwellings at Bandiler Mponument, left us saying, \"WOW!\" But the biggest surprise had to be White Sands. I thought it might rate a mildly interesting day trip. The drive from Almagordo (about 10 miles) was mostly flat wasteland. An adobe Welcome Center is a few yards off of Rt 70. A brief stop for a for snacks and water (there's no restaurant) and you're on your way. A 16 mile paved loop road takes you into an unreal world that becomes more amazing the further you go. When you finally reach the apex of the loop you are in a white world of fine gypsum sand. You can climb the dunes and feel the amazingly cool sand on your bare feet. Youngsters have a ball sliding down the dunes on plastic saucers. We were there in early Sept. The temp was in the low 80s. It was a perfect day but temp can reach 100 in the summer and wind storms can close the road. There are plenty of trails for hikers but once you're away form the vegetated areas there is nothing but whiteness to the horizon. Hikers who want to challenge this envoirment are warned to thave a compass. White Sands National Monument...worth the trip?. New Mexico, worth the trip? Most definitely.",

We spent an enjoyable 5 - 6 hours at Valley Forge National Historical Park, which is only a 30- minute drive from the Philadelphia airport. It was a crisp fall day; the leaves were turning. The day began gray and rainy, but eventually the sun came out. We started at the Visitors Center which has a well-done museum containing artifacts from the site, and exhibits portraying the life of the soldiers during their encampent at Valley Forge during the winter of there. We also viewed a 15 minute video that was at best, average. There are lots of walking trails, and we took advantage of a loop trail that is actually paved and winds its way around the park. The loop trail is about 5 miles and winds its way through woods (we spotted a deer), across fields, and around the main parade grounds where the soldiers were trained by Von Steuben. There were no battles at the site, but it was an important staging ground for the Continental Army during the bitter winter of 1777-78. The Continental Army gave bonuses of $12 to the soldiers who could complete their log cabins in the shortest amount of time. At first we were disappointed because other than some log cabins -- most of which appeared to be reproductions of the originals -- there wasn't a lot to see. We were ready to leave but then decided to find the house at the park that was George Washington's headquarters. That was the highlight of the visit. The house was built sometime in the 18th century; much of it is restored, but there are some original parts of the house. Gen. Washington rented it from its owner. The park service guide did a wonderful job telling us about the house. If you go to Valley Forge, don't miss George Washington's headquarters. If you have young chidren, they will enjoy the \"reenactors\" who are dressed in 18th century military uniforms. Guided bus tours of the site are available for a fee. This is worth a visit if you have any interest in the Revolutionary War.",

The memorial itself compliments the natural landscape surrounding it, as does the original Frank Lloyd Wright visitors' center. Now half the mountain is defaced by a gray granite monstrosity (gift shop, restaurant, ice cream shop, t-shirt shop, parking garage, etc.) and amphitheater that looks like an unholy combination of a suburban outlet mall and something out of a Nazi-propaganda film. If you want to see the faces of the presidents as they were probably intended to be seen, view them from one of the many overlooks in adjoining Custer State Park, where you can see them without Disneyland in the way. If you absolutely must go to the memorial itself, look in the other direction. The unobstructed view of the badlands and prairies stretching from the edge of the Black Hills, which is available from the top of the parking garage, is one of the best in the area. Oh, by the way, forget using your National Parks Pass, you're still going to get socked with a nice \"parking fee.\"",

It's divided into two areas(so you'll need a car) with one part in Johnson City and the other 14 miles away in Stonewall. The visitor center is located in Johnson City. It features some nice displays on LBJ and the timeline of what was happening at the same time. It features two films, one on LBJ and the other on his wife Lady Bird. I thougth the one on Lady Bird was nice. LBJ's boyhood home is across the street. You can only view it during a tour which is free. I think it's worth a visit. The Johnson City area also features the Johnson Settlement. I frankly think you can skip this part especially if it's a hot day or it's hard for you to walk. It was a long walk for something that's not really that exciting to see. As for the Park in Stonewall, you stop at the state park and pick up a CD for your visit. The CD includes some information on what you'll see and stories from LBJ. It was very helpful and free. I liked hearing LBJ on part of the CD describe some of his events. You are also able to stop at the Texas White House and take a tour. It costs one dollar and at the moment only features 3 rooms. As the National Park refurbishes more rooms they will become open to the public. I thought it was very neat to see inside the house and on the front lawn. One note about this national park. You now drive through this area in your OWN car. You no longer take a tour bus. It took me about 4 hours to visit both parks, but I also watched both films at the visitor center. I think you could easily do the whole thing in 2 hours if you wanted without feeling cheated.",

There are several picutre spots along the trail, but if your not up for hiking be sure to only take the easy part of the trail. We started on the easy side and then thought that the difficult side would be fine because it looked to be all downhill; however, it does climb again and can be difficult for some.

It was just so beautiful to walk the island trail, circling the canyon, passing the 700 year old homes of the Sinagua people, in ruins, but close enough to touch. The pine trees and brush throughout the canyon made for the most striking views. In total, there were 300 rooms built throughout the canyon (you will pass 25 dwellings along the trail), so everywhere you look, you see some evidence of another \u2018home\u2019 built into a nook of the canyon walls. This was in such stark contrast to other ancient dwellings I had visited which sat by themselves\u2026this was nothing less than a thriving community. I like how a previous reviewer put it being like a \u2018condominium settlement\u2019. The island trail is a one mile loop that takes you 185 feet into the canyon (about half way into the canyon). There are a total of 480 steps on the whole loop (240 each way) with long stretches of pathways in between your decent and ascent. Because of the 7,000 feet altitude, it can seem like a harder climb; but no one is timing you, stop and rest along the way (there are benches). Have on good walking shoes. There was a drink vending machine at the top of the Island Trail for those that haven\u2019t planned ahead. If you are unable to handle the sometimes steep areas of the island trail, there is a flatter Rim trail and an absolutely gorgeous view from the visitor center\u2019s windows. Enjoy!!!",

Once we got there, it was again not well marked. We weren't sure which parking garage to go into. Fortunately we found a parking on the street. The visitors' center itself doesn't have a lot to offer. There's a small gift shop, restrooms, some models of the outside of the houses, an open theatre area which was showing some strange musical production, and a counter with 2 rangers. We went the day were were leaving Boston and had to catch a flight, so our time was limited. In talking to the rangers we had the impression that the trolley was the only option for tours, but that you could drive to the different sites/ homes, and tour the grounds. We were disappointed but thought that was our only option. The next trolley tour was over an hour away in starting and \"they were running a little late\". We drove to the old house and were able to park right in front. We walked over to the carriage house and were surprised to find more rangers there. They told us we could take a tour of the Old House if we wanted. There was a tour scheduled in about 15 minutes, but \"that they were running a little late\". We waited on the front porch of the home as directed. When the trolley finally arrived, the group was large. They decided to split it into 2 groups - one to start in the home, the other to tour the grounds and the library. We went with the house group. It took an hour to go through the house and it was really interesting. The house was home to four generations of Adams. The fourth generation Adams was an historian and realized the historic value of the house. He got the family together and they agreed to donate it to the park service on the condition that nothing would be added or taken away from the property. As you walk through you see a clock that was made in the 1600s that was a wedding gift. You see the chair that John Adams died in. The whole place is REAL and the ranger gave us a lot of background information as we went from room to room. We loved it, but I don't know that children under the age of 12 would have the attention span or interest to spend the amount of time that it takes. I don't know what the cost is because it was par service week (or something) and everything was free. I hope we can make it back to see more of the site when we visit again.",

We visited on the Tuesday right after Memorial Day and found no crowds at all. We took the New Entrance Tour, which has a ticket limit of 114 -- we had just 7 people in our group and it was fantastic! The ranger guiding the tour was able to get into a lot more explanation and interaction with such a small group. I strongly recommend you visit on an \"off day,\" because this must be hard with a large group -- you have to walk single file, and there are only a few places on this tour where you can gather a group for a talk about what you're seeing. New Entrance is a good tour if you are concerned about strenuousness. You walk down 280 steps, straight down a shaft, at the very start. But you only have to come up 220 (to a different exit), and these steps are spaced out along the route, not all at once. $12 per person and well worth it.",

It was a unique experience, made so by the park rangers who tirelessly lead people from around the world on the cat walk around the base of the monument. Its great to be able to get so close to the Presidents. Also the local,, collared, wild mountain goats are quite an attraction; you can get within 4-5' of them for photo opps. Stay away from the cafeteria food, if possible. Though the huge room with a beautifully decorated, giant mantel piece, dedicated to the American Indians of the area, hold 300 plus people, the food is sketchy. The gift shop is enormous and contains everything from very high quality (and priced) hand crafted sterling and semi precious stone of amazing designs, to the salt and pepper/shot glass Presidents and everything inbetween. We went the week before Memorial weekend to beat the crowds and it was worth it. There are tons of touristy hotels close to the monument, but we stayed in Rapid City, about 30 minutes away, which for us, was a great choice. \"Rapid\" as the locals call it is friendly, clean and big enough to have some terrific restaurants (especially the Italian downtown...Bellisimo?) and 3 Starbucks! We are flat water kayakers, so there were lots of places for us to get our boats in the water, at no charge. Love to go back!",

We went in June and it was quite hot, which also detracted from the enjoyment as all the rock pathways hold heat. Too many people. I suppose it would be nicer in the off season with fewer people.

        "text": "I recently spent the better part of a day at Valley Forge on a trip to Philadelphia and it was the highlight of my trip. I am very interested in history and took this trip because I wanted to visit Valley Forge. I was not disappointed! The park is free, which should make it a place all travelers in the area should visit. The only thing you had to pay for was food, which I got from the Chapel Cabin Shop and it was delicious and very reasonably priced. The day I visited was very warm so I drove my car along the Encampment Tour route. The nice thing about the park is you can walk, bike or drive and you don't really miss out on anything anyway you choose to go. I started by viewing the introductory film and then headed out on the tour. Each stop is clearly marked on the map and along the road. There is a parking lot at all the stops and lots of informational signs. I found that I was pulling over at other points as well to take photos of markers or just the scenery in general. The highlight was probably seeing the headquarters of George Washington, but I enjoyed the whole park. Make sure to take the Inner Line drive. It is the road right after Washington's Headquarters that veers to the right. Not many cars went that way when I was there so I was able to drive slowly and enjoy the scenery. I would recommend this park to anyone with an interest in American History and really everyone in general. A wonderful, inexpensive way to experience how our country began.",

Parking was easy, and the ranger at the visitor center was very friendly and helpful, as this was my first visit. I took the shuttle to the Lower Town. It then started to rain and rained the rest of the day! I walked the quick Virginius Island trail. There are good restrooms in Lower Town next to the bookstore. The short 2:00 pm ranger talk was helpful in placing Harpers Ferry in history. I then walked around the historical buildings. It reminded me very much of Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan! The walking bridge across the river was fun, and the walk up to the Jefferson Rock was easier than expected. The Bolivar Heights area was isolated. When I go again, I will walk the Maryland Heights and C&O Towpath trails and do a float trip!",

A fair amount of period pieces to check out, like the cooking gear, and the muskets they used. You can pick up a map of the area which indicates 10 different sites to check out. There is a short movie, but our timing was off so we skipped it. You can jump on the bus/trolley (I believe there was a fee), ride your own/rent a bike, walk, or drive your car. Walkers/bikers--lots of hills!! Only stops 2 and 5 were interesting to us--#2 a series of log cabins (reproductions) that you could look into, one you can enter. #5 Washington Headquarters and Train Depot. HQ was cool--no hands on stuff though. Train depot just had more info placards and pictures--still being developed I guess. Feel free to ask questions of the characters, they were very knowledgeable and good with the kids. The rest of the stops were just drive-bys of arches, cabins, and statues of famous people from the time.

Odds are, no matter where you are driving from, you will see your fair share of beautiful scenery along the way. The reason we chose this time of year to visit Bryce was so we could see the famous Utah snow draped atop the canyon. We made our way past Arizona, St. George (UT), and Zion National Park (visited Zion only two weeks ago) to one of the many entrances to the Dixie National Forest. The forest is home to some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. Taking pictures a plenty, we would sooner or later get onto UT-89, and from there drive straight to Bryce Canyon. Because we were visited the park on Veteran's Day, the park was free of charge. It is usually $25.00, but it is most certainly worth it. The visitor's center holds an award-winning film that explains the history behind the canyon. Believe me when I say, that had my wife and myself not seen the film, we would have left the park later that day with more questions than answers. The film is free, so you might as well sit back and relax for twenty minutes, while you absorb the enigmatic background of Bryce Canyon. There are two different experiences you can take while driving through the park. A drive to Bryce Point and back is about four miles both ways. A drive to Rainbow Point and back (passing other major view points) is about seventeen miles both ways. When we got to Bryce Point, a Stellar's Jay (which we seen during the film) landed in a tree only about a couple of feet from where we were standing. We were able to get some really nice close-ups. We then walked the trail to one of the most scenic vistas anywhere, Bryce Point. I cannot even find words to explain it, other than unimaginable. At Bryce Point alone there are an incredible amount of different types of formations, but the biggest one is the amphitheater. Bryce Point is one of the highest points in the park at 8300 feet. Next, we continued to Paria View. Again, amazing formations mixed with a light snow made this the ultimate experience. We stopped by the Bryce Canyon Lodge which is currently packing everything up for the winter season. It will reopen in April. Not only was the scenery the most beautiful in our opinions, but the week before the lodge closes up is probably the most desolate time to visit the park. You pretty much have the park to yourselves. That doesn't happen during the Spring, Summer, and early Fall (especially May-August). We saw an abundance of Mule deer as well. Our last stop was Fairyland Canyon. This is where that famous scene of a balancing rock above all other formations can be seen in person. We liked everything about our trip to Bryce. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It doesn't matter whether you're an outdoor person or not, you absolutely have to see Bryce Canyon National Park!",

That was also worth the trip, especially after dark. Note a visitor may not see the actual lava flowing from this side either, unless a special tour is arranged ($55 per person, I think, from a vendor set up at the end of Route 130). ",

There is a 30 minute lunch break, with cash only box lunches for $7.50,drinks and snacks or you can bring your own food unclear ziploc bags (no purses, camera cases or bags of any other kind are allowed due to homeland security concerns).

We stopped at the Visitors Center, which is just inside the park gates. We looked around a bit and picked up a map. Then we hit the road. We headed down Crater Rim Drive first, toward the Jaggar Museum. On the way, we stopped to check out the Steam Vents (easy walk from the parking area). It was really odd to see steam coming from the earth like that. This is where we got our first look at the Kilauea Crater\u2026you can see it in the distance from a little viewing area near the vents. After our first look at the crater, we were so excited to see it closer!! We headed to the Jaggar Museum (when we visited on 11/11/10, Crater Rim Drive was closed beyond the Jaggar Museum). We got out of the car and walked toward the museum. This is the only place during our entire trip where we detected a sulfur-like smell in the air. Certainly not overpowering in any way - and once you pass the National Park sign for the museum, the smell went away. We walked around the museum to check out the displays. They have a bunch of huge rolls of paper behind a glass wall which appear to be tracking seismic activity all over the area. They also have some samples of lava for you to check out. There is also a small Vistors Center where you can pick up some souvenirs. Don\u2019t plan to eat here \u2013 there is no food or drink. Then, the big moment\u2026.we walked over to the viewing area and there it was\u2026.the Kilauea Crater!! There was a vent in the crater with steam pouring out constantly (thankfully the steam was heading away from the viewing area). As of our visit, there was no visible, flowing lava here\u2026.just steam. But it is an amazing view. According to one of the rangers that was walking around, the lava is about 150 feet below the surface. I could have just starred at it for days. But, we didn\u2019t have days\u2026.so we left the Jaggar and came back down Crater Rim Drive, heading back towards the Visitors Center and the Park Entrance. ",

Initially we were worried as it has snowed a few days before but we lucked out with perfect weather to drive and walk around.

Bliss before heading overseas, I wasn't sure if he would want to spend an afternoon frolicking in the sand...but even he agreed that White Sands is an absolute MUST when you are in the area. It is a $3.00/person entrance fee, which is good for 7 days and includes additional activities like the Sunset Stroll we took at 5 PM. When you first arrive, the visitor's center is across the breezeway from the bathrooms and they sell postcards, magnets, and offer literature about upcoming events at the park. There is also a knowledgeable ranger on staff who can answer questions about the park. There is a short film you can watch, which was not in operation when we were there. Behind the visitor's center is the gift store where you can buy more White Sands memorabilia and purchase a large disc sled for sledding down the dunes. To buy a sled is $14.95 and they will buy it back for $5.00. There is also sled wax for sale at the counter. It's 99 cents per block and is used to wax the bottom of the sled to keep the sand from sticking to it. We did not discover any of this until we were ready to leave the park so I'm sharing it with you now to keep you from making the same mistake. The Sunset Stroll, which starts 5 miles into the park from the visitor's center is also a must. The sun turns the San Andreas/Sacramento mountains an amazing color of orange when it sets and the sands are just brilliant. The stroll is led by a park volunteer and only ventures 100 yards or so into the dunes. I did it barefoot. ",

It costs money to get in but your ticket is good for 7 days. This is a good thing if you can\u2019t experience everything you want in one day or if you go on a cloudy day and want to return on a sunny day. Start at the Kilauea Visitor Center and ask one of the Rangers what is going on in the park the day you are there. They will give you a great map and bring the highlights to your attention. The Jaggar Museum has excellent displays with seimographs and other equipment used by scientists to monitor volcanoes. This is also the closest place to look into the caldera. Our other favorite spots were the Thurston Lava Tube, Kilauea Iki overlook and the Holei Sea Arch.",

        "text": "This park consists of two sites, several miles apart. You visit them on a single two-hour tour, traveling by trolley from the Visitors' Center to the birthplaces and then to the home where John and Abigail settled when they returned from Europe and where John Quincy, Charles Francis, Henry, Brooks, and other eminent Adamses and their families lived, right up to the mid-20th century. To me, the latter was most interesting, and stories about the people who lived and visited there are fascinating. (Our NPS Ranger guide was excellent). For bibliophiles the Stone Library, built in 1870 to accommodate the books accrued by the Adamses up to then, is a breathtaking venue. The birthplaces are classic New England saltboxes, very sparsely furnished; once you've been there you can check them off your life-list of Presidential Birthplaces (though not the actual rooms where John and John Quincy were born) and you probably won't be motivated to return; I'm not. (Our NPS Ranger there was not as good). But I am keenly looking forward to visiting the \"Old House\" again once I've learned more about all the Adamses. Caveat: the Visitors Center, where the bus tour begins, is on the ground floor of a nondescript modern office building in the center of Quincy. There's an identifying sign but no directions about where to park. You'll find an attached parking garage in the rear, which is free of charge on weekends. And when you travel on the bus you'll be subjected to the driver's taste in music....",

The forests are spectacular and the sequoia trees are truly a wonder of nature. We stayed at the Wuksachi Lodge in the park so that we would be close to the hiking trails and could get an earlier start each day. The Lodge was nice and a definite recommendation. You definitely want a camera and sturdy hiking shoes. Our favorite hike was up to Moro Rock, an enormous granite monolith that has spectacular views from its top. The hike up was a bit arduous so be prepared to walk up about 400 stairs and pass some spots where the guardrail is discontinuous. The climb is well worth the effort. We also spent half a day in the foothills, hiking along the river and that was fun. The foothills area was about 30 degrees warmer than up on the mountain and was much more humid. The one complaint we had about the park is that we didn't find out until we got there that there was still 4-6 ft of snow on many trails, making them rather inaccessible. It would be nice if the park rangers would post conditions on their website. Also, some services (e.g. museums, snack bars) were not operational during the first week in May although the website said that everything was officially open on May 1. Oh well, we made due with what they had and had a blast. We were there for one day and a half and we wished we would have spent another day there so that we could have driven up in the King's Canyon part of the park. If we go again, we will want to see that for sure. Have fun!",

In short, it was exactly what you would picture the Wild West looking like. There is a small fee to enter the park ($10 per vehicle per week, plus other rates depending on how long you wanted to stay), but the 24-mile loop was easily driven and quite scenic. The ranger at the gate told us that the South Unit (in Medora, ND) had around 350 head of bison. Still, I didn't really expect to see any. We drove for about 30 minutes before we encountered any wildlife (not counting prairie dogs - they're everywhere), but the experience was unforgettable! Feral horse herds walked right up to the car, and pretty soon we were surrounded by herds of bison, so close you could reach out and touch them! It was fabulous! There were a number of hiking trails that wound through the park, as well, that afford a more intimate view of the scenery and wildlife.

The Scenic tour is only $8 for adults, a steal in the Black Hills as all the other attractions are a lot more. The cave tours regularly sell out so if you want to see the cave, call them before you head out to find out if there are tours still available and reserve a tour. It is so easy to do and you don't have sit around for hours waiting for your tour time, only 30 minutes. The cave is 53 miles from Rapid City but it takes a lot longer than you would think to get there. The tour itself is great, a lot of stairs but half of them are going down. And there flights are fairly spaced out so even if you can't do more than a 2 flights without getting wind you should be fine. They don't rush you through either. I've done many cave tours and this one is one of the best. The formations are interesting and you also get to see some box work which is what Wind Cave is mostly made of.

We just followed the road around the caldera, well as far we could anyways...the road was closed in sections because of high levels of noxious gases. This didn't matter however, as you could still access all the parks attractions. We walked around the Sulpher Banks which was interesting and stinky :) The view from the Jagger Museum is breathtaking, especially at night. We walked through the Thurston Lava Tube, down the Devastion Trail, and went to the many lookouts throughout the park...and I would recommend ALL of it, if you have the time.

You won't need a lot of time once over there, but there's a catwalk on the mainland and you can walk that a couple times. It's also a nice place for a family picnic (mainland) with tables and stuff.

In spite of the short stay I had time to ride the shuttle bus to Bryce Point and then to Inspiration Point. From there I hiked the Rim Trail back to Sunrise and Sunset Point. Had lunch at the General Store, then hiked down the Navajo Loop through the Wall Street Slot Canyon. If you do not like heights then this trail can look intimidating but the reward at the bottom is worth it. Once you pass through the slot canyon keep going as the views are worth it. Just bring water and plan to stop and rest along the way. After hiking back out of the slot canyon I rode the shuttle back to Ruby's Inn and then drove my car all the way to Rainbow Point while it was still daylight. The view of the Grand Staircase is tremendous. On a clear day you can see all the way to the north rim of the Grand Canyon. By the time I was leaving the sun was going down and the wildlife was coming out to eat. Stopped several times to watch deer eat on the side of the road. I covered a lot of ground in only 8 hours. By the way, if you have Red Canyon on Hwy 12 going towards Panguich is worth a visit too.",

There we paid a $150 fee and proceeded into town where we met up with Rick Garland's \"O Be Joyefull\" tour as we were instructed. It was an excellent and informative tour, but when our bus came to pick us up, an NPS ranger advised our driver he couldn't come up High Street as planned. The group had to walk back down the hill to the depot, catch a shuttle bus back to the Visitor Center, then meet our coach there. On the way, one of our guests was confronted by a NPS ranger and treated rather rudely...very disappointing and quite the opposite of my other experiences with these usually very friendly and informative folks.

The campground was cheap, clean, secluded, and quiet, which is everything I ask for in a campground. The cave attraction itself was definitely worth the money. While the city itself on the outskirts of the national park has clearly declined in recent years with many businesses closed down, there was still plenty to keep us busy. We visited a Wildlife Museum that was actually a lot more fun than we thought it would be. The museum featured taxidermy animals and was definitely an old museum, but I ended up sharing a lot of laughs and taking a lot of photographs with my friend.

        "text": "On a recent trip, I convinced my family to detour off of I-84 on a drive from Salt Lake to Boise to the visit the Golden Spike National Historic Site. I wanted to see the place where the first US transcontinental railway was completed in 1869, but I did not know what there was to see or do there. To our surprise, there was much to see if one has some interest in US history. The story of the building of the railroad is fairly well known, but we did not realize that Promontory Point, where the Golden Spike was driven in May 1869 was one of the most difficult parts of the railroad to build because it is so steep. We could see the old railroad grade climbing up the Promonory Mountains as we approached from the Salt Lake area so we started to realize this was a tough spot to build a railroad even before we reached the museum. We also did not know that Congress had allowed the two competing railroad companies to each build a right of way for the rails (at government expense) so there are actually two railroad grades visible at the Golden Spirke site though only one was ever used. Finally we were delighted to see that that the National Park Service conducts a daily recreation of the actual driving of the Golden Spike during the summer and they have two working steam engine locamotives that are close replicas of the ones that were actually used in 1869. That was the highlight of our visit. We also explored the small but nice museum and did a portion of the car tour that takes you along one of the old railroad grades to see how they built the railroad in the 1860s. The railroad now takes an easier route that bypasses the Golden Spike site so all the tracks have been removed except for the track used for the driving of the Golden Spike re-creation. Overall we felt our visit exceeded our expectations. If I went again I would check the Golden Spike's website to see the schedule for the driving of the Golden Spike re-creations which includes the two steam engines chugging up the tracks to meet. One from the west and the other from the east just like in 1869. Great sight to see if schedule allows",

It really just had the feel of a tourist trap. I was very much looking forward to visiting the Lewis and Clark museum but found it very lacking. The entire \"museum\" was located in one single small room. The reconstructed firehouse where John Brown and his party were captured was interesting and definitely the highlight. The majority of buildings were shops, bars, or eateries. If you are in the area it would be worth stopping by just to say you have been there. Otherwise, I am sad to say I could not recommend going far out of your way to visit the site as I feel its historical significance is not represented very well.",

You are not allowed to enter the park with your own car. You can walk , but that would be impossible. You are required to use Aramark industries as a private consultant, and they will drive you in on a packed old school bus for $45-$120 per person per day. But, you must also pay the park entrance fee on top of this to the park service of $10 per person. A complete scam. No other park, specifically Yellowstone, the grand park, does such a terrible thing. You pay $25 at Yellowstone for a 3 day unlimited pass for one car to the entire park, as a taxpayer should. On top of all of this, the wildlife is very limited and is certainly not compared to Yellowstone. The people are scammer types that charge $30 for a baseball cap and $15 for a hot dog type, if you know what I mean. What a huge disappointment.",

        "text": "Take time to visit Jewel Cave, the 2nd longest cave in the world, if you are in the Black Hills area on vacation. Jewel Cave offers several different tours. The Scenic Tour (only $8 for adults) is one of the most popular and fills up quickly. You can call ahead to reserve/purchase tickets which I highly recommend. The scenic tour lasts about 1 1/2 hours and involves walking up and down 723 stair steps over a 1/2 mile loop, equal to about 40 flights of stairs. Some of the stairsteps are steep but overall it's very easy and not strenous. On this tour you'll see two types of calcite crystals, nailhead spar and dogtooth spar, which are the what Jewel Cave is known for. You'll also see formations of boxwork, flowstone, cave popcorn, draperies, stalactites, stalagmites and a long ribbon drapery that our guide referred to as cave bacon. Our guide was very knowledgeable so it made for an interesting tour. I would recommend this tour more for adults and older children. There were a few babies and young children on our tour and they became quite fussy and disturbed by the darkness shortly after the tour began.",

We flew into Jackson and spent two nights at the Rustic Inn in a lovely log cabin on a beautiful creek overlooking the mountains. The Inn was 10minutes from the airport and within walking distance to downtown Jackson. The rate includes an unbelievable huge breakfast with lots of choices.Dinner at the Blue Lion was fabulous with a wonderful guitarist serenading us softly during our meal.Cafe Genevieve was a perfect place for lunch with great reasonable comfort food. Mad River Rafting was excellent for white water rafting and they supply wet suits,booties and slickers which I highly recommend as you will get wet and have a blast! Take the tram up the mountain in Jackson Village for unbelievable views and the best waffles and hot cocoa when you get out at the top.After two nights in Jackson, we headed to the Grand Teton National Park to stay at Signal Mountain Lodge. This could be the best family vacation spot ever! It is set on Jackson Lake surrounded by the Tetons with wrap around views that go on forever. We had a wonderful upper lake view unit 160 with two double beds, a big comfy leather sofa, stove top, microwave and full size fridge and bath.I would highly recommend an upper unit unless you have small children or a dog, then I would suggest a ground floor unit or separate log cabin. Our unit was smoke and pet free. Everything is very clean, but not fancy. There is a convenience store, gas station, gift shop, and three restaurants. with organic and gluten free options.The Peaks , has unbelievable views in a beautiful fire placed dining room with great food and service. The staff are friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to be working there.Andy set us up with a motorboat at the marina steps from our room to zip around the lake and explore some of the hidden coves. You could also canoe , kayak or rent a larger pontoon boat. Johanna , at the front desk, set us up with horseback riding at a family ranch about 25 minutes away followed by lunch at an adorable place called the Buffalo Cafe with great burgers and huckleberry shakes on a screened porch.Yellow Stone National Park is just minutes from Signal Mountain. Pack a picnic,water,beach towels , sunscreen and lots of bug spray and plan on a full day of exploring. We spent time swimming in Moose Falls and found a perfect picnic spot, but did't have enough time for the hour and a half trip to Old Faithful. The next day we took a shuttle boat to Jenny's Lake for some great hiking to beautiful Cascade Falls and amazing views from Inspiration Point.We had the best pizza and homemade ice cream 20 minutes from Signal ,at Leeks. The line was out the door, but well worth the wait. Once inside the big retro styled dining room overlooking the lake, we joined families of many different nationalities sitting at picnic tables sharing pizza and bopping to the oldies ,piped in from the ipods of the fantastic group of young people working there. Watching the staff singing and dancing as they worked made us all smile and enjoy the fabulous pizza even more. ",

It\u2019s a flood plain so it occasionally floods throughout the year and it\u2019s a swamp most the rest of the time, but it was quite dry when we went. There were so many things to see, from the large looming trees that make up the canopy, the fallen trees various plants, and other things that make up the floor, the insects and animals that live all around, and so many unique things.

It is right off of Interstate 70 between the White Sands Missile Range and Holloman AFB in Alamagordo. We have visited a few times in the past couple of years and they have quite a bit to offer for the whole family. You will first park at the visitor center where you will find a lovely adobe gift shop and media area where they show films about how nature has created the spectacular site. As this is part of the National Park Service, you will find a wealth of information about this natural wonder. The fee for entrance is $3 per person and you have the option of walking on trails or driving the 8 mile loop around the park. We chose to drive as it was hot most days when we visited. As you enter the park itself, you will be astounded by the abundance of pure white gypsum sand that surrounds you like sand dunes on a beach. You will see nothing but white, almost like you were in a winter wonderland. Along the road you will find areas where you can pull off and walk into the dunes. There are boardwalks along the way as well and roof covered picnic tables for the family. The park service offers many educational programs throughout the year and they even give tours of the lake that creates the sand several times a year. This is just a spectacular place that the whole family should visit when in New Mexico. You will feel like you are on another planet, as there is nothing like it on this Earth!",

The visitors center has a great exhibit featuring the national monument along with a short video that educates visitors on the formation of the sand dunes. Once you enter the monument, you can choose many different routes to take and pick your dune. Never very busy when we go there are covered picnic tables available with grills. The kids and adults:) alike enjoy sliding down the sand dunes in waxed bottomed (candles work) saucer sleds (approximately $10-15 at visitors center so if you have one, bring it!) Watching the sunset from the top of the dunes is amazing. Dogs are allowed but must be leashed. Alcohol is prohibited during \"spring break\" times (call ahead if concerned, I think during March and April) and they will check your coolers. Be prepared to have a car full of sand, no matter how hard you try it sticks on your clothes. During the summers can be very hot so recommend going early in the morning or later in the evening.

My 8 year old enjoyed it along with us, but anyone much younger I noticed ended up leaving before it was over. Dad had to turn off his hearing aids for the shooting of the gun.",

We stayed in the Ravenwood Motel in Klamath (& loved it but it is pretty isolated) then we spent a day travelling north & another day travelling south. Starting north on your park map & heading south: we would recommend the Howland Hill Rd. drive & the Stout Grove trail. You can walk over to the Battery Point Lighthouse but nearby is the Seal rescue center & you can walk around outside & see if they are re-habbing any animals & give them a donation for the awesome work they do. We liked the Yurok Loop trail and saw a bald eagle & we also did the Trees of Mystery. We drove the Newton Drury Pkwy & we did see some elk near the visitor center. We really liked the Fern Canyon trail (you can only hike it for a 1 mile loop if you want)--highly recommended but $8 per car load. We also liked the Trilium Falls Trail--we saw elk here too.

I can say without hesitation that it is one of the most spectacular places I have ever visited. It is almost a secret though. I visited mid-week and there were very few people there. I was told it is much busier in fall and spring when the water levels are higher and it is more conducive to canoeing. Park admission is free. There are 2 campgrounds; 1 is primitive with no facilities. The visitor center is small as national park visitor centers go but there is a good introductory film that I recommend before exploring. The park employees were all very friendly and informative; they enhance the experience. If you only have a few hours to spend at the park the Boardwalk Loop Trail is the way to go. It is 2.4 miles long and it must have been quite a project to build such an extensive structure. The next morning I was going to hike the 10 mile River Trail but a ranger recommended the 6.6 mile Oak Ridge Trail instead because of the spectacular oak trees along the way. She also said this time of year the River Trail gets overgrown with vegetation. I took her advice and am glad I did. Most of the trails start out on the Boardwalk Trail and branch off from it. The trails are well-blazed and there are well constructed footbridges over all water crossings. On the Oak Ridge Trail I did not encounter one other person, but I did see deer and I believe wild hogs, which I kept my distance from. As I was the first trailblazer of the day I did encounter countless spider webs spun across the trail so if you suffer from arachnophobia what are you doing in the deep woods to begin with lol. I cannot come up with appropriate words to describe the majesty of these soaring hardwoods (and loblolly pines for good measure). There are several champion trees here and I saw sycamores, oaks, beech and other trees that I never imagined could grow that tall. It is hard to imagine that just 35 years ago this area could have completely fallen victim to commercial interests. Thank God for the people who fought to preseve this most special place.",

Each angle is a different view and brings new surprises, even just 25 yards further along the rim. Get out of the car. Soak in the amazing geological history. We took the time to hike down Cleetwood trail and take the 2 hour boat trip around the lake. The climb is not easy, but we are middle aged and took our time. It is well worth it. The views from the lake level give a whole new view of the geology. The US National Park Service Guide was a fountain of knowledge and taught us fascinating things about the Crater and its history.

His wife, Carolyn, chatted with us for several minutes and her story was likewise as interesting.In the early morning hours there is a minimum group of people thus leaving a lot of the viewing space for just a few. Buses don't start arriving until mid morning. You will be charged $11.00 to park however the entrance to the monument is free. Fees of this type charged by concessionaires under contract with the National Park Service is slowing ruining the publics perception about the Park Service. The other concessions, such as the gift show , are also tun by large corporations determined to get your last dollar and many times providing a cheap , shoddy imported product as a souvenir. There is a gift shop and cafeteria on the grounds, plus a theater that will give you the story of the construction. The gift shop has numerous books about the monument and unless you just have to have the book at once, I find jotting down the name and ISNB number and waiting until I return home and make the purchase off of Amazon where I save 30 to 40 percent off the retail price. Plus I don't have to lug that book or books around for many more miles. The little town Keystone is located just down the road and there you can get a cup of coffee or maybe a sandwich.

We had been to the Muir Woods Sequoia forest the day before so it was interesting to compare this experience to that. The weather was gorgeous that day, warm and sunny with really bright blue skies, but the limited parking areas were full by the time we got there, well before noon. We had to park about a mile or so on the road and walk back, but it was free. The entrance fee to the forest is $5.00 per person. After paying that you can visit the gift shop, eat, drink, go to the restroom or just proceed into the redwood area. There is a whole different atmosphere upon entering the forest. It is a humbling, almost hushed attitude that the visitors have while in it. I looked around while walking the several miles that we did that day and there were people visiting from several nations. I could hear snippets of german, korean, italian, french and some indian and arabic dialects being spoken around us. After a mile or so inside the forest, there is a clearing where one can sit on a bench, reflect, take pics, etc., and where a park ranger gives a 15 minute talk on the history of the forest and how very difficult it is to grow a majestic redwood to maturity. A tiny redwood seed must go through a gauntlet of issues before it has a hope of becoming a fully mature tree. This was fascinating stuff to me. The natural beauty and history of this forest, on the day that we were there, was pretty much perfect.",

Everyone has seen pictures and everyone knows what it is. But to finally see it in person was breathtaking. It almost brought tears to my eyes (seeing the monument combined with the fact that it was an infamous anniversary). The weather was gorgeous the day I was there (80s and sunny)--unseasonable for South Dakota in September. I do recommend you do some online research before going to Keystone so you know a little bit about prices and places to stay and best places to view.

I proceeded on to Grant Grove Village, and found I was just in time to make a Rager led walk through the Grant Grove, so headed that way. The Ranger was an ex-teacher, who was very engaging with our group. In fact, he was so good that people along the way fell in with our group to find out the history and biology behind the Giant Sequoias. By the time I left Kings Canyon at about 2:00 p.m., there was a line of cars backed up down the hill about 3 miles, so I would suggest that you get there early to avoid long lines. Grants Village had a nice welcome center, gift shop and restaurant. There was a lot more of Kings Canyon/Sequoia that I did not see, as I did not have the time, but what I did see was worth the drive up the mountain.",

The tour starts from downtown Quincy where a trolley takes you to the houses where Adams family members were born, lived, worked and died. The tour guides from the National Park Service are extremely knowledgeable and pepper their historical narrative with interesting anecdotes. The whole tour takes two hours and time passes quickly. There is a nominal fee and photography is prohibited inside the buildings. The tour is family oriented but very small children might be restless by the end. Part of the tour requires going up and down stairs and the only bathrooms are at the Visitor Center where you begin and end. The tour is seasonal and closes down during the winter.

Following day can be done on same car ticket one time $11....park is well managed and operated. Park in lot #6, closest to the promenade for handicap access. Wheelchairs are available on sign out. Daytime overflight by jet fighters...awesome display. Lots to see, must take the Presidential Trail to the viewing platform....go to the left...easier walk going down the stair cases (250 steps). Gift shop was infuriating....only a few items Made in America, the rest made in China. So we only bought items MIA, their loss. Would have spent a lot more. Ice Cream cone was $4.75 for the smallest, more than a pint...seemed like a quart...way too much price and quantity...enough to freeze your brain. Mount Rushmore is a symbol of our great nation and the tone here is of a sacred nature....too bad the gift shop hasn't gotten the message....this is one place for America only. Better get here before Obama either grinds his face over Lincoln's or he sells it to the Chinese who will probably grind up the rock and put it in our food.",

My wife and I and our two kids (3 & 5) and another family with same age children. It truly is a magnificent sight. I believe its 300 square miles of pure white sand dunes in the valley of some mountains. Definitely go to the visitor center and watch the short video. Even our young kids enjoyed it. It is also worth buying the saucers (sleds) in the gift shop and don't forget to buy the wax there too. You will want to keep the saucer good and waxed to enjoy a fast ride down the dunes. An unwaxed saucer won't go anywhere. There are two options. You can buy new or used saucers to start and you can turn them back in after you use them for a small refund. I think a new one was about $14, and they give you $5 back if you return it. I didn't know there were used ones or I would have pick that option. Anyway, the bottom line is that this is a worth while destination where you can easily burn up several hours. You can pack a cooler with food and beverages (take lots of water) and enjoy the day. Keep in mind my visit was in September... I have know idea what the heat would be like in mid summer. Probably not as nice of a visit I would imagine. If you don't enjoy and appreciate this sight, you simple don't have an appreciation for nature and the great outdoors. Enjoy.",

As we understood things, there were quite a few redwoods that were enormous but a volcanic eruption covered the bottom feet of the trees and eventually left them in a petrified state while the taller parts of the trees disappeared. The stumps are unbelievably huge. There were many more of these petrified stumps a century ago but visitors chipped them to pieces in attempts to take samples home. Those that are left are protected.

We were ushered into a theatre to watch an extremely informative and interesting video on the life of George Rogers Clark and the battles that took place in that area during the time of the Revolutionary War. After the video, the ranger in charge escorted us to the monument and inside, we were given audio sets to follow the diarama depicted on the walls. Turns out, that monument is the largest outside of Washington, D.C. We were all very impressed.",

        "text": "This is more of an informative review based on \"what to do\" before you get there. Number one and foremost is Do Your Homework! We took my 91 year old Dad to see the caves because it was his wish to do so. I looked over the website and found two tours offered that were considered \"easy.\" At that point I should have purchased tickets (but did not) and I should have printed out the Fall Schedule (but did not). I suggest you do both! Also, before you go, I would check a milage guide (on the web, which I did) and calculate the approximate time it will take you to drive from your starting point to the caves. From there, add on at least 30-45 minutes (which I didn't) for parking, discussing tour options with a ranger, buying a ticket (if you do not have one), and a bathroom call. FYI: The caves sit back from the main highway about 7 miles. We traveled from Nashville and by the time (10:30-ish) we arrived the EASY Tour (only one offered) was at 9:45 AM and again at 4:30 PM. We were too late for the one and far, far too early for the other. Many of the other tour times were filled and were not really do-able for us with all of the stair climbing, etc. One male ranger felt sorry for us, I guess, and said that they MIGHT add on another tour at 12:45, but it was not announced so far and he could not guarentee that. Needless to say, we did not tour the caves and the opportunity to do so now is slim. So, I am giving the Mammouth Caves a 5 and for myself (a seasoned traveler who should have known better) a 1. Since school had started, I thought visitors would be at a minimum. That is not the case. Far too many people out there do not have school-age children or otherwise. A site does not become a National Park for nothing. So do your homework and plan well enough in advance, covering all angles and you should have a wonderful experience.",

Do not forget to get your parking ticket validated at the National Park desk when you buy your admission ticket! We were with the first group of 10 for the first tour of the day at 9:15. Some other members of this group told me that availability of the tours is limited and tour groups take availability first. The others in our group had called the day before to check for an open tour time. I just showed up at 8:30 and sat on the Park Service doorstep and got lucky. My daughter (age 11) and I enjoyed the tour very much. Staff very knowledgeable. Plan on two hours. If you want to stay and walk around the grounds at Peace Field, you can, but must wait about 30 minutes for the next trolley. Adult ticket was $3.50, my daughter was free.

The first day we walked a few trails,, visited the historic Murphy Farm and visited the Visitor's Center. We took quite a few beautiful pictures. We also got to go thru a bus that had several sections of artifacts that was very educational. The second day we took a park shuttle bus that had several stops.

The diverse colors in the badlands landscape, the juniper and cedar greens, the herd of buffalo that walked within feet of our car, the feral horses, pronghorn, and mule deer made it a superb place to visit. We drove the loop and walked three short trails all in 3.5-4 hours. I would love to come here again and hike one of the longer trails! It is not quite as moon-like as Badlands NP in South Dakota, but this park's version of badlands may have been taller and more diverse in coloration. A great place to visit!

The tour location takes about an hour to reach by NPS van, and once there, it's about a two-hour walking tour through the Hensley farm lands, their service buildings, and one of their homes. The scenery is beautiful, and our ranger-guide, Sharon, did an exceptional job of keeping us informed about the Hensley family and how they survived in this remote location. It gives one great appreciation of the hardships some of the early pioneers endured just to survive. The tour costs $10 ($5 with a Golden Eagle pass), but it was well worth the time and effort.

The leaves were blazing with color and there was a good number of birds, squirrels and even a small snake out and about.

So, we headed out the door and began a steep descent into this amazing canyon. There were pueblo homes all around. Unbelievable. When we got down we saw a sign that said island trail on the right. So we took the trail to the left only to find out from a friendly guide that we were halfway around the island trail going backwards! It was o.k. By them and the guide was happy to inform and answer any questions. This trail takes you past and even into these homes. Thankfully my knee held out pretty well, and I have to say that it was worth it! We did do the easy one while we were still there, but missed the ruins again due to lack of signage.

In addtion to the lava flowing, there are hiking trails, old lava tubes, and a road from the top of the mountain to the ocean through various old lava flows, some still smoldering. In all it is a good National Park to visit with very friendly staff. One last word of caution, take warm clothes. We forgot our sweatshirts and had to buy them in the park...which were not cheap...and we were not alone as MANY guests found themselves buying sweatshirts and windbreakers, as it was also raining the days we visited.",

You first go to the Visitor's Center across from the train stop in Quincy and buy your $5 ticket (great value!) From there you take a trolley to the boyhood homes of John Adams and John Q. Adams. They stand next to one another, preserved for posterity in a busy residential area. They have been restored to appear as they did during Adams' occupancy. Some furnishings are original as the homes remained in the family until donated to the Park Service. You tour each home, which takes less than 30 min. total. You then get back on the trolley to drive 10 min. to tour the home John Adams bought later in life and lived in until he died. This home is exquisite and contains numerous family furnishings. You get a real sense of how they lived. I highly recommend that you read David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize winning book \"John Adams\" before you visit, as it will offer great insight into one of our greatest Founding Fathers and most under-appreciated Presidents. John Adams arguably did as much or more to secure America's freedom as any man, including Washington. Unlike Washington and Jefferson, Adams was not born rich, but he was determined to gain independence. A great American! John Quincy's youth in Paris with his father during the Revolution inspired him to become President, too. The first father-son Presidents. Go see where it all started.",

We finally got a break from the rain, though, on the second morning, but only for a few hours. If it's raining, go somewhere else. You can't see anything and it is very miserable since at 4000' it's cold, windy, and dreary in the rain (yes, even in Hawaii it can be cold). If the sun does shine, then you can see the caldera, take a few drives to the volcano tubes, or see the main steam vents near the observatory. I heard from others that they had enjoyed their helicopter flyover on a sunny day, and this was something I had wanted to do if we had had the time. The entrance fee is $12.00 per car, but for some reason there's always a wait to get into the park, longer than one might expect. Once you do get up to the gate, the entrance fee is good for about a week, so you keep your receipt.

We had seen pictures and heard about the Mount Rushmore National Monument so we pretty knew what to expect..or so we thought.While doing my on line research I found out that the Chief Crazy Horse Monument was nearby and the annual fall buffalo round up would be held at Custer State Park while we were in the area. WOO HOO! We expected the buffalo round up to be the high light of our trip. After all, how many people can say they have been to a wild buffalo round up? I made arrangements to take a bus tour from Rapid City to Mount Rushmore, the Chief Crazy Horse Monument and the buffalo round up all on one day via Greyline Bus Tours.I read on line that while there is no entrance fee to MT . Rushmore, there is a steep fee to park, which can be scarce during peak tourst season. I figured since we didn't know our way around, the bus made the most sense for us. Be aware that this is a very long , all day bus trip and worth every dime. Actually, the bus ride between Mount Rushmore and the Crazy Horse Monument is what we remember most and tell our friends about. This twisting turning road , called Needles Highway, was designed to take advantage of every spectacular view on the Presidents carved into the mountain. Some places we felt as if we could almost reach out and touch them.We were very glad someone else was driving so we could spend every minute enjoying the views. Our driver kindly stopped multiple times along the way so we could get out and take lots of pictures....so be sure to bring a camera and extra batteries. I think my favorite part was squeezing through a one lane wide tunnel to see the face of George Washington framed in the light at the end of the tunnel. Breath taking really. There are probably quicker, easier routes to Mt. Rushmore from Rapid City but don't pass up driving the Needles Highway. Actually, I wish we had flown to Rapid City and saved our travel time for exploring Rapid City and that corner of South Dakota, rather than driving .There is so much to do and see in the area that we just didn't have the time for. Maybe that means we will go again.",

She greeted us at the dock around 9:30 and we got to see so many places at our own pace - six of us with young children and seniors, and there was never a boring moment. She took us to many places for less than half of what the ship wou charge us and we got to see so much more! Ask her about the huge (for Hawaii) cactus, the garden at the back of the macadamia nut factory, and the rainbow trees. The big sea turtle was one of the highIights towards the end of the day. And we usually beat the croud. We paid at the end of day with a credit card and she took us to the ship at around 3:30. She used her own camera and took many pictures for us. When we got home, the photos were already in my email inbox. Couldn't have asked for more. Highly recommended!",

In most other lakes, we were told, you usually would see below water surface up to say 100 ft. But, at Crater Lake, you see much, much deeper below surface. The air is also so fresh. Add a sky as backdrop, with some white clouds, hmmmmm. For vacation purposes, there is no place better than some spot in the U.S., esp. the national parks. No place where it's so well-equipped, humanly and naturally, and bargain basement costs (a mere few dollars entrance fee).

Well a trip up to the Lowell National Park in Lowell, MA, will help answer this question. The National Park offers a combined canal, trolly and mill tour, which is informative, fun and a great value. I worked in Lowell for years before going on this tour and am now sorry I waited so long. The canal tour takes you in a boat, through manual 100+ year old locks to the Great Francis Gate. Park Rangers and historical actors drive home the importance of this canal system to the industrial growth of Lowell. The trolley tour is fun and relaxing and you can even see an actual mill turbine in operation. All this in one tour for less than $10! A fun and informative visit for the family.",

From this campground it was an easy, 30 minute walk to the lookout at the Jagger museum - where you can see the glow of the lava lake in the Kiluaea crater at night. During the time we spent in the park, there was a surface lava flow reported that was just inside the park boundary at sea level. We checked with the rangers and they explained that it was a arduous, exposed 4.5 mile hike to get from the end of the Chain of Craters road to where you could see lava. We decided to go for it. Since we were cycing around the island, we didn't have a car, so we hitched a ride with a very nice couple from the Visitors Center. The hike was INTENSE we brought tons of water and covered up with long sleeves, pants and hats but what we saw in the end was totally worth it. Molten lava flowing into the sea - we got within 30 feet. It was amazing!! And then, of course, the 4.5 mile hike back! The Visitor's Center is excellent - make sure you stop there and get the important information about how to view the lava safely, it's extremely hazardous - but SO AMAZING!",

We had four children with us; 7 y/o girl, 10 y/o boy, and two 12 y/o girls. I was worried about the difficulty for the 7 y/o and wether she would freak out or not but she did great and led the charge through the whole thing, we were amazed!. Once you get into the Cave for the Lantern Tour they will give you the option of an easier tour or a more difficult challenging one. Dont be scared the difficult tour is very easy and manageable. They take it slow and I had no claustrophobic breakdowns. The tour before us voted on the easy path and the adults said it was dissapointing so make sure you push for the \"Purgatory Path\" Like most have already said, not everyone needs to hold a Lantern, the young kids have battery operated ones but the younger kids can suffice with parents holding it, so they can use they're hands to help pull them around.

From my understanding, the town largely rolls up shop from Christmas to March, but you can still find places to eat and a few shops doing business. One of the main draws of the park and the town is the rich slice of American history, much of which is well preserved. This area is friendly to hikers, history buffs, families, and even dogs.

Instead of taking the excursion, it is easy to see the park at your own pace and save a lot of money by renting a car. I simply reserved a rental car from a Hilo airport rental car agency several months ahead of the cruise. When we arrived in Hilo we disembarked and the all the agencies had shuttles right from the cruise ship dock to their location at the nearby Hilo airport. The National Park is about 45 minutes away and easy to find with few turns but for assistance I had brought my GPS from home along. After we were done with our day at the park, we returned to the airport, dropped of the car off and took the shuttle back to the dock. The whole process was surprisingly smooth and simple and the cost of the rental and entrance to the National Park ($10 per car full) for the four of us was about the same as the price for one adult excursion!",

The National Park Service is exceptionally user-friendly for military groups for planning to conduct a historical study of the battle. We were able to get the cost of park entry deferred by submitting a memorandum to the park superintendent outlining our plan of study for the visit. We also arranged to have our visit led by the Antietam park historian, Mr Keith Snyder, a 20 year veteran of the park and a national guard senior officer. Mr Snyder's breadth of knowledge and experience at the park made for an incredible experience of professional development and helped the battle come alive for us. He covered the terrain and the strategic setting for the battle as well as discussing the decisions and some of the sub-plots of Antietam that occurred that fateful September day. The battlefield is well-preserved, and the park staff has it as their on-going mission to make and keep the park grounds in as close condition as possible to the way things were when the fighting occurred there. This is a great place to visit to better understand our nation's military history, military decision making, and leadership. Having such a knowledgeable guide was a key enhancement, though there is a self guided tour map available with informative signs along the way. Overall a highly recommended way to spend a day of historical study. ",

It's $6 to get into the park and a bus shuttles you from the visitors center down to the lower town so you don't have to walk. The park is set up like a little town and you can go into the different buildings and learn about life in Harpers Ferry before, during and after the civil war. There's also a lot of information about John Brown's raid. You can go into some of the homes and even visit the Catholic Church in the town that still holds mass every Sunday. Make sure to go up to Jefferson's Rock where the view from the top of the mountain is absolutely amazing. You can see where the Potamac and Shenandoah Rivers meet. When we were there, the Shenandoah was an emerald green...so beautiful! You should also walk across the footbridge over the Potomac (i think it's part of the C&O Trail) and get more scenic views looking back at Harpers Ferry. Make sure you also walk along the river and check out Virginius Island. You can walk right up the river and there are old ruins on the island. ",

Make sure you arrive early enough to put your name on the list. Someone canceled last minute, so we were very lucky to get to go on it. We had to pay a small fee but it was definitely worth it. This cave required hardhats and lanterns to navigate. Also, be prepared for a lot of stooping and crawling around. The tour guides were phenomenal and very knowledgeable of the history of the cave and gap.

Bring water and suncreen. The park consist of a drive through monumental Sand dunes. They dont seem to finish. The beauty is that the sand is powder like (gypsum) and is white.

Definitely walk around the wooden walkway and most people should be able to do the loop--maybe a mile [guess] when it's all said and done and mostly level so not really physically demanding; some stairs here and there so I think handicapped folks would be somewhat limited in making the entire loop. Get some good vantage points from nooks and crannies of the fellas on the hill and the trail leads you over to the small museum where there is a video of the construction and a mock up of some equipment. All told two adults can swing the whole thing in 90 minutes including taking pictures but do that stuff during the day. Come back later at night using same parking pass, grab some ice cream and bring it out for a good seat for the evening lighting ceremony. There was an excellent movie that last 20-30 minutes around dusk followed by some narrative from a ranger [and a song actually], and at least on our night the ranger asked veterans to stand and be recognized then come down to the platform for retiring the Colors.

You can stop and go as you please.......LBJ's grandparen'ts home, his childhood home, the family cemetary where he and Lady Bird are buried, plus the livestock barn and then the airplane hangar which is right by the Summer Whitehouse of LBJ. The hangar now houses a visitor center and gift shop area. There you can purchase your tour tickets for the retirement home (formerly the Summer Whitehouse) of Lyndon B. Johnson for $2. A Park Ranger gives a guided tour. It was wonderful. The furnishings are like you stepped back into the 1960's. We were there the later part of January and the weather was wonderful. The Ranch was beautiful. We loved our time there. After we left we traveled on to Johnson City. That is were the Lyndon Johnson Visitor Center is.

The new permanent exhibit, showing how the monument had been constructed, was also fascinating. That said, as a foreigner (long resident in the US) I couldn't really see what all the fuss was about. Mt Rushmore probably means most to an American schoolchild who's been learning about the presidents in class, and who enjoys tracking down his or her state flag - the flagpoles are arranged in order of admission to the union, if I recall - to stand proudly beside it for a photograph. For the rest of the world, though, it's tempting to see these giant faces as another example of the American taste for everything large, from bacon double cheeseburgers to SUVs. Like McDonalds, Mt Rushmore is well managed and full of families having a good time, so a visit is pleasant enough. But, though other places commemorating American history - the civil war sites, the Vietnam memorial - can move my foreign soul, that's not the case with this one. ",

        "text": "We booked this one-day trip through Viator and run by Polynesian Adventures. This was going to be one of the highlights of our Haiwaii vacation and cost me almost $1000.00for a day trip. This cost was a very large part of our budget and was greatly anticipated as a once in a lifetime treat. In retrospect, I shpuld have known better. The advertising site showed photos of smoke and red lava-flow and also indicated that a spectacular night-tour was available. I took this to imply that we had a chance of seeing some lave. Wrong! we were collected by coach from our hotel and then waited for two and a half hours at the airport before flying to the Big Island to be told immediately by our driver on the ground that we would not be seeing any lava-flow that day or any other. A bit late to cancel then. What followed was a coach trip around the Big Island visiting some sights but mainly spent long stops at souvineer-type attractions and the worst lunch I have ever struggled to force down. We did see the crater and some steam at one point but this stop was around 10% of the total time. At the end of our tour, the driver said we were very early for our flight back and did we want to roam around the shopping mall? Er, no! A complete waste of time and money. On return I complained to Viator who managed to obtain a partial refund ( everything but flight costs). This went some way to compensate us financially but nowhere near compensating all 3 of us for severe disappointment with our once-in-a-lifetime trip.",

I heard that the area and faces were not in good shape but all of the faces seemed to be in very good shape. The various views among the Presidential Trail were very nice. The walk is just right. My 2 year old was able to hang in there and make it all the way around. The cafe onsite was a bit expensive so we did not eat there. Nice experience. Would recommend it. (Parking is $11 per car but that is the only $$ you are required to pay and the pass lasts for the rest of the year for the same vehicle. Not to your benefit if you rented a vehicle as we did.)",

We stopped at the visitor centre and were pleased to see they conducted free walking tours taking you to the best vantage points. The volunteers were wonderful and obviously happy to be there. Views were amazing, guide was knowledgeable discussing all flora, fauna and history. It was recommended we return at night to see the volcanos glowing and we decided to do this, it was so worth the drive, It gets really cold though so take a jumper or somthing warm to wear. You can also stop at the lava tubes and I would recommend taking the time to do this. Im glad we hired a car and did our own tour as the tour groups seemed to be very rushed.

My wife doesn't enjoy history as much as I do but she also enjoys the visits just as much as I do. There is so much to do and see and for the price you can't beat it. The park provides an amazing insight into four generations of the Adams family (from 1720 to 1927). The park has two main sites: the Birthplaces of 2nd U.S. President John Adams and 6th U.S. President John Quincy Adams, and Peacefield including the \"Old House,\" home to four generations of the Adams family, and the Stone Library which contains more than 12,000 historic volumes. You can also go across a little way up the road and visit the graves of both of the presidents in a church (for a additional fee as it isn't part of the park). There is no place else where you can see the birthplace of two presidents and their graves all at the same time. ",

        "text": "Aloha everyone, OK, so maybe Mauna Loa summit by way of the Mauna Loa Trail isn't on everyone's \"bucket-list\", but it was on mine... so, after several months of careful planning, a good safety plan, and a last check of the forecast, off I went. Now to be sure, Mauna Loa summit via the Mauna Loa Trail is NOT a leisurely day hike. It's a strenuous multi-day backpacking trip with several nights and days above 10Kft. Given the altitude, limited water availability, and the occasional 'outside-the-forecast' weather, if you're contemplating this one, I suggest plan, plan, plan. The HVNP has a good website for backcountry hikers, so read and heed. (You'll also need to check in with the rangers at the backcountry office to get a (free) permit to access the trail.) There are a few other websites that describe the trail, have forecasted weather for Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa summits, and there's even a 24-hour webcam at the summit so you can see summit conditions. The trail starts at 6700ft and climbs over both kinds of lava (\"a'a\"--the jagged, broken kind found in smaller chunks in your backyard barbeque grill (not fun) and \"pahoe'hoe\"--the kind that looks like black cake batter slopped all over the place). You'll definitely want trekking poles! The trail itself is marked by lots of 'ahu' or stone cairns. Your eyes will tune in to see them and the faint discolorations and wear of years of foot traffic on the lava. The ahu range in size from a foot to nearly 8 feet tall, so if you're walking along and don't see the next one, just stop for a second and let your eyes find it...it's there, trust me (although sometimes they hide behind trees and shrubs at the lower elevations). Both Red Hill Cabin and the Summit Cabin have cachement systems for water. The summit tank runs a little brown, so opt for boiling snow if you can--at least it looks better. Note: it's very arid up there, so do NOT shortchange yourself on water--drink lots). Both cabins have bunks (plywood racks) with some foam pads and some old sleeping bags. You can use them to pad the bunk and the spare sleeping bags as extra layers if necessary. There's a rustic table in each cabin and a cooking spot. The cabins are NOT heated but will keep you safe (mostly) from the elements. Red Hill is at 10Kft and is about an 8 hour hike depending on your speed and acclimitization. (FYI: I recommend getting a prescription for Diamox/acetazolimide to be on the safe side for the potential altitude sickness. I took it every 12 hours and had zero problems.) After Red Hill, the true summit or the Summit Cabin are both about 11.2 miles away--a very long, brutal, and cold uphill slog above 10Kft--- the puffing, fatigue, and pain is the price of admission to the awesome spectacle that is the Mokuaweo'weo crater. I elected to go straight to the cabin and hike the summit the next day. The Summit cabin sits on the edge of the crater so you'll have a grand view of the crater, the true summit, and the stars later. Another good pastime is to read the 'Red & Black/Black & Red' log books of all the hikers who've gone before you...great stories you'll definitely be able to relate to and you'll be proud to be in their company! I finished the adventure with a power hike to the summit and then back down to Red Hill... about 16 miles, but I did it in less than 9 hours. I paid the price of having both big toenails go black--ouch and yuck, but it's more cosmetic damage than real pain--although ibuprofen is a godsend. Overnighted again at Red Hill and then down to the trailhead--Basically two days up and two day down. I only saw three hikers on the trail going up as I was going down, so lots of solitude! Well, after all that, I'm not sure it sounds like all that much fun to a lot of people, but if you want the big get away (few, if any people) and you want to hike up an active volcano with a low probability of it blowing up in your face, then try Mauna Loa in the late fall, winter, and early spring...Anyway, do your homework and plan it well and it'll be worth every step...it's full of stunning views and the summit crater should be considered one of the great wonders of the world. The landscapes leave you both humbled and amazed at how small we can be in the universe. Enjoy!",

Take a light jacket and maybe sweats it may be cool and rainy at times. I advise to stop first at the ranger station. You can\u2019t miss it. They are great to advise you where to detour and what to see. Since this is mother nature you never know if steam and certain gases may reroute your direction of travel after you are in the park. The steam vents are everywhere and they can burn you if you are too close. If you decide to hike get advice on the website www.nps.gov/havo/index.htm , you need water and good shoes. Also when you travel the island you see helpful signs that say danger in 3 feet they mean just that. Its not like it is on the main land, where when they say danger you can kind of push it. IF they say stop turn around DO IT!! They are not playing. I have been twice to the park. I have only seen a huge hole in the ground with steam. It looks like the surface of the moon. I have never seen the volcano erupt, not many people have. And watch out for the so called dinner cruises that show you where the lava flows to the sea. They will charge you take you out and make like oh I guess you can\u2019t see it today. Talk to the park rangers ask them questions. They love their job. Aloha",

We enjoyed looking at the baby owls in the trees outside and taking pictures of the area - until our camera battery died that is... No back up battery either! Silly us... Luckily the adorably sweet woman in the gift shop allowed us to charge it while we waited for the ferry. 20 minutes of charge and we were able to get all the pictures we wanted. I am forever grateful to her! The fort itself is very small and primitive. There isn't a lot to do or see, so do not go expecting a big event. It literally only take 30 minutes to explore the 2 rooms, read the few historical signs, and go to the top and back down. The guide was knowledgeable, but not very chatty.

We were there in March which was a good time since the weather was so nice this year and it wasn't that crowded. A lot of attractions on the way were not open at this time of year but we managed to find enough to keep us entertained. The fee is $11.00 per vehicle. They have a restaurant that was very good for a limited menu. I had the chicken fingers which were some of the best I have had. My daughter had a sore throat and could only eat soft food.

The entrance fee is only $5 per person, which is cheap for what you get. Outside the visitor center you're greeted with an amazing view of the canyon and the cliff dwellings that reside in the sides of the canyon. If you\u2019re feeling up to it, you can walk to the bottom of the canyon for some even better views. The park ranger said it was 220 stairs or so to the bottom, but we counted 300+ from the visitor\u2019s center down to the very end of the canyon trail. Easy walk down, not so easy on the way back up, so make sure you bring comfortable shoes and some water. At the very end of the canyon trail you walk right by cliff dwellings and get a much better idea of how people lived in them...it was pretty cool to see. We would highly recommend stopping here if you\u2019re in the Flagstaff area as the canyon provides beautiful views, interesting sights, and a lot of stairs!",

I strongly suggest that you check the boat schedule times online before you go...although there are several boat rides to the fort each day there is a mid-day gap that we have hit more than once & it's hard to spend an hour- hour and a half waiting because there's not a lot else to do here unless you bring a picnic. Weekdays are a great time to go if possible & we recently had the unexpected treat of seeing a family of great horned owls nesting near the visitor's center!

That is why you will see dozens of European & Asian countries represented to experience this God's gift to man! Whodo's, spires, pinnacles, fabulous hiking trails and more. Always take a huge shade hat, a big neck towel in the summer to wet and stay cool, plenty of water & energy snacks. A minimum of 24oz even in the winter and 48oz in summer. Always have anti-slip shoes, & it is highly recommended to have some great Liki Summit shock poles to take the stress off your knees & feet. They make the down hill and up hill, so, so easy on your body. Weather old or young you have to try great hiking poles if you are going to do a hike with 200' to 800' elevation changes like the ones in Bryce Canyon. I love those Austrian made poles which are around $100 at Sport's Chalet. They have the most shock which really helps pushing you up and down the Wall Street & the Queen's trail hikes. Without poles you better be young and in good shape. The weather was around 45*F which was fabulous for hiking. You never broke a sweat. I was there hiking a dozen trails year's ago in mid-August and it was around 100*F, and beastly hot to hike. I sure could of used my old US Army cool down kerchief's and wet towels. The sand stone just radiates the heat back in your face. A huge shade hat and tons of sun screen with save you from being burnt to a crisp which most of the novice hikers were every time I have been here. If you go that time of year start your hikes at sun up. The sun's rays are so intense. The elevation will get to you if you have breathing problems. It is over 7,000' to 9,000'. I did have problems sleeping at Ruby's Inn due to the elevation. Of all my hikes from Mittenvald Alp in Germany, to Switzerland and the forests of Yosemite & Sequoia California National Parks, I rate the geologic splendor of Bryce Canyon & Zion National Parks the two places you must visit before you die. If you just drive to the dozens of pull-off view points and take pictures, it is fabulous. If you are handicapped don't let this hiking turn you down. There are great ramp areas to see. If you have breathing problems, just take your portable concentrator, which I saw several. I took my Albutoral and it was fine. The roads are excellent with speeds to 65mph. The only slow and low area is the narrow Zion tunnel which they had to make one way for some big motor homes when I was coming back. On this tour from Las Vegas you get to see Zion too which has a nice shuttle bus and a handicap trail. Just do it! If you have only one place to see in the entire USA, go to the combo-Zion & Bryce Canyon National Parks. Go on-line and you will see if it is for you. I have been there three times in my 50yrs of traveling all over the world and I still come back to get close to nature and the incredible fresh air of Southern Utah.",

When people have asked me about the Antietam battlefield located an hour away around tiny Sharpsburg, Maryland, I tell them it's farmland with a few markers scattered about. It's hard to tell the single bloodiest day in American history happened over these few acres, maybe due to the lack of monuments and markers that you see on some other prominent battlefields. But what you do see, including the upside-down cannons for the six generals who fell on that day, are as telling as anything you'll see at any national park. Get yourself a good guide book and follow it along, but be careful. A lot of the roads you'll be driving on are rural, as is most of the area, so be sure to look out for the proper spots to drive down. Bloody Lane, a sunken road that was the spot of some very fierce fighting, is neat to walk down but be sure to park before you'll get there, as there really is no stopping point from the regualr road to it. The park service bookstore inside the visitors' center is small but has lot of great items not just from Antietam but also some items from the Monocacy battle that was fought around Frederick and some great maps.

The cute western frontier stores are so cute. The nice/budget friendly gift shop and grocery store connected to Ruby's Best Western at the park entrance and Cowboy's awesome buffet restaurant. Down home cooked food. It was so tasty. It will cost you about $20 per person. Very nice National Park. You can drive yourself to each look out point and I'm not a hiker but I took the Mossy Creek hike to the waterfall and cave. So serene. So beautiful. Love, Love Loved it.",

This is a National Historic Park. More information on the park can be found on the National Park Service website at www.nps.gov If you have a National Park Passport Book you can get your passport stamped at the visitor center. There is a walking trail along the beach, a picnic area and rest room facilities near the visitor center that is located just off A1A a 20 minute drive from St. Augustine. It is open every day except Christmas from 9am to 5:30pm. There is no admission. The boat runs every hour beginning at 9:30 am so you may want to time your visit to catch the ferry. There is a short video about the fort at the visitor center. The boat trip affords you beautiful views of the Matanzas River, Rattlesnake and Anastasia Islands. The fort was built to protect St. Augustine from attack from the Matanzas inlet. The restored fort gives you a look at what it would have been like to be a soldier assigned to the fort. A national park service ranger gives an overview at the fort and then lets you roam around but is available to answer your questions. There are several cannons including two originals. If you are small enough to fit thru the opening you can climb a ladder to the obervation desk of the fort for beautiful sweeping views.",

Make sure to stop at the visitor center just off Unser Blvd on Western Trail. The Park Ranger in the visitor center will give you some great information on Petroglyph's and even recommend where to go. He recommended that we go to Boca Negra Canyon a few miles north of the visitor center. Parking was $1 and at the time we went there were plenty of parking spots. In Boca Negra there are 2 \"mountains\" with 1 main trail at the first stop then 1 main trail and 1 small one at the second stop. Both have parking so you can drive over after the first stop. Each trail only takes about 30 minutes max but you can spend more time searching out Petroglyph's if you like. You start by climbing the volcanic rock and looking for Petroglyph's, you actually acend upwards a decent height before you come back down the looping trail. The park service is trying to start a cell phone information line where you call a number and at different locations they give you interesting facts about what your looking at. I tried it and it was pretty cool but unfortunatley its still in a test phase, hopefully they'll improve on it as I rather enjoyed it. My kids had a great time and had no problem climbing the trails. Definately alot of fun for a few hours of exploring.",

The blackened walls in the dwellings, blackened from the fires they used to cook and keep warm will reach your soul, at least it did mine. If you are someone who values the feel of history surrounding you then this is certainly a place not to be missed. Once again I need to pay homage to Teddy Roosevelt who was responsible for all the beautiful, mysterious, and awe-inspiring experiences I have had here in the West. These parks are a blessing to all who come here. It is worth the steep walk, you can stop and just drink in a most incredible view of Roosevelt lake a little over a thousand feet below you.

Started backpacking late Friday afternoon from the gate and arrived at the flats about and an hour forty minutes later. The uphill climb and afternoon sun made for a good work out! The campground offered nice, shady sites with clean restrooms nearby for our scouting group. With nightfall, came the million dollar view of the twinkling lights below....hard to believe we were only minutes from the city! Signs warn of rattlesnakes and should not be taken lightly as we saw a baby rattler camouflaged at the foot of a tree the next day. As far as things to do, you can take a hike up to Mt. Wilson (half our troop), work on a conservation project with the ranger (the other half), or read a book and watch squirrels scamper up and down trees (what I did), it's all good and it's all free!

If you can hit up a ranger talk at the lookout tower at the very top, do go!

One cannot help but be impressed with the work done, and the dedication to detail on the faces of the four presidents depicted. It was really inspiring. We decided to have the grandchildren participate in the Jr. Ranger Program. If you are not familiar with this program it is well worth the time (no cost) and the kids really learned about the site. I wish I had thought to take down the names of the Rangers we spoke with, who went over the kids booklets, gave a little pop quiz (our five year old grandson, when asked by the Ranger who was the president with the glasses, proudly answered \"Teddy Roosevelt!\" to the pleasant surprise of his mother). The Rangers we spoke with were pleasant and well versed in the information about the monument. The gift shop had lots and lots of items, although a few items that would be what a 2/3 year old would like, would have been helpful.

It is only a short 20 to 25 minute drive out to the Monument from Rapid City. It is truly an impressive place to be. Parking was $11.00, but there is no fee for touring the monument, grounds, studio, and museum. Happy to pay to park as the entire place, including the parking was paved, clean, neat and user friendly. The only problem we encountered was that we were a few weeks early for the busy tourist season. Some of the area attractions and the sculptor studio at the monument were not open. We visited during the last week in April. Mount Rushmore is truly an attraction that everyone must see! Make a time and go see it! We went back out to the monument in the evening. The faces are lighted about 15 minutes after dusk and remain lit until about 9:00 pm. Wow, what an impressive place. We enjoyed every minute of our visit. Allow a few hours for the visit and wear good walking shoes so you can take the President's Trail. It is about a 1/4 mile walk with some steps to negotiate. It is worth the time and effort. It will put you right up under the faces for some uniqe photos. Nice lunch room and gift shop on the site. Over a million visitors a year. You should be one of them!",

It cost $25 per car to enter the park but the pass was good for 7 days. We did notice several shuttles driving through, but we thought driving our own car let us have more control of our time.

The fort itself is actually pretty small and only takes about 30 minutes to explore and take pictures.

The tour was two hours and two miles. I'm overweight and lazy, and had no problem managing the hike. Every inch of the cave tour was fascinating. I strongly recommend a small LED flashlight to shine in the cracks and corners as you go. The park lighting is just enough to see your general surroundings, but I wanted more. The tour guides don't spent a lot of time talking, the cave speaks for itself. They stop at a few significant points, but mostly they let you walk and enjoy. I would say it's a bit much for any kid who can't get around on their own. It would be an awesome adventure and memory for any eight year old. You do NOT want to carry a child through this. If you are very obese, there are a few spots that might cause embarrassment. This is a tremendous value at $12.00, but coupons for 2$ off can be found in the area hotels. It's a national park, so every dollar goes to very good use. You could call it a day after one tour and be quite fulfilled. Book ahead because I'm told the peak season often sells out early.

The visitor center has great detailed maps with explanations for levels to each person can go at their own pace. I found that if we went into the challenging caves we just turned around and went back when it got to be too much for us. The visitor's center sells knee pads ($13) so if you plan on crawling I would bring your own or buy some before heading out. You can also purchase hard-hat type helmets there for around $7. We brought bike helmets which were more sturdy and stayed put. The best cave for the beginner is Sentinel cave because you can walk all the way through it, the path is really developed and they even have stairs in places. Skull Cave and Merrell Cave require a lot of stair climbing to get to the bottom so be prepared for the long climb up those same steps when you are coming back up. ",

(I was able to cheat a little my son lives just outside of Philly and he was with us) Many places are free however you may need a free ticket. Only 2400 tickets are given on a daily basis for Indepence Hall and are given out fast. You may get a ticket at 10 but your tour time may not be until late afternoon - which may be a problem. Indepence Hall and the visitor center where you get your free tickets are about 3-5 minutes walk apart. Depending on the time of your tour you can walk the area's other sites. Or someone can get your tickets while the others wait in line at the liberty bell for you. (In you went long ago the Liberty Bell is now in a building). Be sure to look up when you are at this and any historical site to see the great buildings. You go in and out of buildings I did see people with strollers but I don't think there are elevators because they were carrying them up and down and one place where the senate met they didn't go upstairs. Be sure you sit where you can hear your guide they do not have microphones. Not a lot of time to ask questions while viewing but after the tour the guides are around to answer your questions. So save your questions until that time. Tour guides are very informative. You will have your bag checked before you can enter. You can take all the photos you want. Get your tickets and while you are waiting to check in for security stop in the \"first city hall\" right there - where the supreme court first met. Planning is the key. Also, no bathrooms - however there are some at the visitor's center. The visitor's center also has several areas to walk around to view history.

Perhaps this is why I was not as impressed with Capitol Reef as I may have been had I not seen the other two parks first. This park is interesting in its starkness but not as beautiful to me as Zion or Bryce. It's also a bit of a long haul from Bryce to Capitol Reef as well, over Hwy 12 with a lot of switchbacks. There was not much to see in the Fruita area, but did enjoy eating a picnic lunch there & buying a small pie from the Gifford Homestead. Bathroom facilities are fairly limited and so is food, so be sure to take your own water & food for meals. Wish there was better signage throughout park. Lonely Planet guide said that a dirt road at the end of the scenic drive continued into the waterpocket fold and we could see Pioneer Registry & some water tanks. However, road is very rough and kept going & going, much beyond a half mile...even with an SUV, did not feel comfortable continuing. Trails / trailheads are not well marked. Also, the rock formations are not labeled throughout the park and the signs for the pullover stops are numbered only going southward (see them in order from north to south, opposite of Bryce's scenic drive, which you should see from south to north). Did really enjoy 2-mile hike to Hickman Natural Bridge and the ranger talk at the visitor's center about the geology of the park. Currently, the theatre in the visitor's center is out of order. Petroglyphs on Hwy 24 are interesting & worth a stop. Park map shows Observation Point to be on east side of park off Hwy 24 but when we drove out there, there was nothing but a small turnaround & the park sign. There was a sign for Observation Point but it was on the west side of the park right before the Twin Rocks going eastward...strange.",

But there are numerous short side paths to make it down to the water, and enjoy a shallow pool all to yourself. Most people cross the bridge and stop at the first set of pools to bathe, here are the shallow water \u201cfalls\u201d but keep in mind if you head for here, lots of other people will probably already be down there. This aside, getting there is the worst. There are about 13 miles of gravel road to conquer. The last 5 of these are incredible\u2026incredibly bad, with rocks sticking up at tire puncturing angles in patches unavoidable to your vehicle, and ruts offering a jarring experience even at 5mph, it is not for the faint of heart and very time consuming to pass. Perhaps this is why there are no brochures of the attraction at the rest stops or visitors centers. Personally, I didn\u2019t think it was worth the journey, and white knuckling the stretch of bad road, but you should definitely weight this for yourself.",

It was awesome. As for the campsite, we encountered a problem along with other campers. We set up camp on a lot with 2 tents and a tarp that took a few hours. The hostess approached us and told us someone else had paid for the lot for a few more days. The prior campers had stayed 5 days and paid for a week. However, they left the site abandoned and we took a chance they had left early. We said we'd leave if they showed back up which they didn't. The same thing happened on the lot next to us a few days later and it was not used for a night even though campers had inquired about it. The campsite is set up first come and people need to leave something to show they haven't left. It says at checkin to place something in the lot to show it is occupied.

Eat at the lodge great food but pricey, pines motel also has good food also not cheap. If u go thru park gate before sunrise the entry is free because gates are unmanned. ",

The only way in is on a converted school bus (at least the seats are comfortable) on a windy, bumpy, mostly gravel and dirt road. The bus is full of tourists with cameras who run from side to side whenever a bear, caribou, moose or bighorn sheep is sited. The restrooms along the way are just fancy outhouses and there is always a wait. You are constantly warned not to leave the area around the restroom or bus or you may be mauled by a bear. The landscape is featureless and the chances of seeing Mount McKinley are about 50/50. Your are committed to at least an 8 hour round trip. A cold and unappetizing lunch is included but bring your own food. Considering this park is one of the hardest to get to in the world, it is not worth the time or considerable expense. It is unique landscape but there is a lot of unique landscape in the world that is much more accessible.",

After learning more about Antietam while there, I wished I would have included Harper's Ferry first, then Antietam, then Gettysburg. If you're going to Antietam, first stop should be the Visitor's Center. They have a film to watch and a nice bookstore. If you want to walk some of the battlefield, go to the bookstore and pick up their $2 booklets for each segment of the battle. The booklets are walking tours of the events of the day; the cornfield, the bloody lane, the bridge, and more. It's good to do the driving tour, but there's something special about actually walking the cornfield and bloody lane that can't be experienced in a car. It was a full afternoon trip to cover the battlefield, so I stayed at the Hagerstown Hotel and Convention Center before heading up to Gettysburg. But, if you have time, go to Harpers Ferry in the morning, then to Antietam. Harpers Ferry is less than 20 miles away from Antietam and it is part of the \"story\" since Confederate troops occupied Harper's Ferry and then made a rush 17 mile foot march to Antietam just in time to provide reinforcement. One other tip, do the Ranger orientation that they conduct at the Visitor's Center. It's only a few times a day, but worth hanging around to listen to the Ranger provide insight.",

The views of the Hoodoo's & surrounding canyon are amazing! These are views you will never see anywhere else. I suggest driving to the last point-Rainbow-& start there. This will give you less traffic to deal with & all the points are on that side of the road so easier access as well. The park has shuttles which take you to each point & they really push this mode of transportation to protect the park. The only problem is the shuttle starts 8am & stops at 7pm. We drove because we started our hike early morning & we stayed in the park for sunset during our drive of the scenic tour. We viewed the sunset from Inspiration Point & it was gorgeous.

        "text": "Crater Lake is not just a \"lake.\". It is impossible to describe to anyone who has never been. Just GO, but save your trip to late August or early September, the perfect time is just after Labor Day when kids are back in school if you want less crowds (it will still be crowded.). Most people don't stay here long because it seems there is nothing to \"do\", meaning this is not a lake resort, it is a visual and sensory spectacular event, a place to return to yourself, if you give yourself the time to slow down and discover the area. If you want the best, stay in the Crater Lake Lodge, but you'll need to reserve far in advance to get a lake view room (the only kind worth the $$$, it isn't cheap.). Stay on the top floor in one of the claw foot bathtub rooms. A warning- no TV, nothing but the view. They do have wi-fi now, but if you have an iPhone, no service- Verizon usually works. But the idea is to unplug! Take the hike to the top of the ranger station at Hillman Peak. Drive down to the Pinnacles. Drive the rim drive and stop along the way. Take the boat tour only if you are in good physical condition - the hike back up is very challenging. The same with the boat ride and optional hike up to the top of Wizard Island. For your first time, do it all- the ranger talks, etc. Even if you are not staying at the lodge, wander into the fireplace lounge early and grab a seat by the fireplace or on a sofa. After 3pm they serve drinks and food there, and you can curl up and read for hours. Or weather permitting, go out on the veranda and snap up one of the coveted rockers to view the lake and hang out- again, they will serve you there after 3pm. The lodge staff are from many different countries and many of them are friendly and great stories abound. Dinner or lunch at the lodge is also a treat in the dining room, but call in advance to make reservations for dinner as it is very popular. This need intensifies as the summer months go on. Really, the lake is only in tourable mode between mid-July and mid-September. I was just ther in early June and there was 6 feet of snow and at times you couldn't see the lake, it was snowing so much. Ther are a number of places to stay within 30 minutes, just outside of the lake, but choose carefully, as many places capitalize on the lake as a destination and aren't as they claim.",

It is located near the missile test range & the area is sometimes closed when they are doing testing. When you arrive the visitor center has a 17 min. film that has great photography although the audio had some glitches. If you have kids, or are a kid at heart, be sure to pick up a sled at the gift shop so you can go sledding down the dunes. New ones cost $14.95 & they will buy them back from you for $5 or you can buy a used one for $10 and they will buy it back for $3. Don't bother to buy the wax as the sled works fine without it. Choose a sand dune that has soft sand & it will work best. Great place to hike, take photos, & have fun. Don't forget to take some water with you because it is hot & they don't have any at the dunes. Only $3 entrance fee for anyone 16+",

My favorite part of the park - the painting! The park supplies paper, watercolors and brushes and encourages everyone to become a part of the park's history by continuing the tradition of plein-air painting! I don't have an artistic bone in my body, and have never water-color painted before. But the artist-in-residence provided some hints, and motivation, and the park did the rest - supplying lots of inspirational spots to paint. It was one of the most pleasant afternoons I've ever spent in CT. And if I remember correctly, there is no charge to use the grounds. The park also has some nice walking trails, though you have to be careful because a couple of the longer trails weren't groomed very well. That's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars!",

We went on the Grand Avenue Tour, $24/each, which started at the Carmichael Entrance and ended at the Frozen Niagara Entrance. This tour was very fast paced, but manageable. I am not in the best shape and was 17 weeks pregnant, but I was glad I made the tour. It was very flat in the beginning and had some hills closer to the middle and end. It finished off with the Frozen Niagara formation, a great way to end our tour. After each major ascension, we were able to sit and rest for about 5-7 minutes. At this time, our guide would tell us something about that section of the cave. Our guide, Kevin, was great. He has been there for many years and is very knowledgeable as well as funny! We enjoyed his humor and fun spirit. After about a 1.5 miles (all very flat), we stopped in the Snowball Room for lunch. They had lunch you could purchase, but we brought in sandwiches and snacks. The website states that you could only bring in food in a clear backpack or ziploc bags, but apparently they've recently changed this and you can now carry in bags or backpacks. They did ask us to bring in clear water bottles, though they never checked this. For $8.50 boxed lunches, I think you got a sandwich, soup and drink. They also had bathrooms and water fountains here. We also stopped a mile later at another restroom.",

Actually, you don't go for the food - get over it. :-) The park rangers were very helpful and the onsite exhibits were exceptionally well done. Some \"complain\" about the parking garage, but given the location, a garage is the best way to get everyone in. $11 per car isn't bad for all you get to see.

There is a gift shop and clean restrooms at the top, which was a great respite from the weather. The park employees inside were very friendly and helpful. While we were there, a park ranger announced he was about to go on a small hiking tour. One of our friends was not appropriately dressed (yes, we told him to bring a jacket but he did not listen)so we unfortunately had to pass on the tour. The views are breathtaking and gorgeous. Make sure you bring your camera and video camera. It is a complete 360 degree view from above the clouds. On our way back down, we pulled over to touch the clouds (great photo op) and at some of the scenic turn offs. We also saw some of the cycling tour groups readying themselves to ride down.

While I had always known something about the revolutionary war encampment here I had no idea about the actual conditions of the soldiers. The guide on our trolley tour, Mr. Rice, was extremely knowledgeable and made the event at Valley Forge come alive for us. The costumed volunteers at one of the camp sites were entertaining and interesting. Going through some of the reconstructed huts gave us an abbreviated sense of the conditions the colonial army endured, though it was a warm sunny day as compared to the winter they went through. The Visitor Center is well staffed with park rangers. The park experience is free though you do pay extra for the trolley tour. The park has walking trails and excellent guide maps. This is a must-see for families wanting to give their children a sense of the courage and determination of those men and women who sacrificed so much for our country and our freedom.",

It is basically a visitors center (admission was $3 per or $5 family), the grave of Abe's mother, the site of their cabin, a spring, and a replica working farm with live animals. There are also some hiking trails (not terribly long or difficult) which I enjoyed the best. Especially the trail with 12 stones scattered throughout, marking events in Lincoln's life (e.g. an actual stone from the White House during Lincoln's time). I found the hike very interesting! There isn't that much to see in the Visitors Center and some may balk at the entrance fee, but I found the 14 minute movie quite interesting and worth it. I was not aware of how much time Lincoln spent in Indiana and that it was during a crucial part of his growing up helping define who he was as a man. If you have young kids, since this is a National Park (this goes for all National Parks) have them participate in the Junior Ranger program. It helps make the visit a fun learning experience and when they complete the book, they get a badge. My daughter has gotten quite a few of these over the years and displays them on a vest. A nice keepsake as she gets older to remember our trips. We spent about 3 hours total there.",

We watched video about the fossils and petrified red woods before we walked around the park. I think it is the best place to start so you know what you are looking at. To make it even more fun for the children, I highly recommend doing the Junior Ranger program which is free. The children have activities to complete while there after which they can earn their junior ranger badge. My kids loved it! The petrified red woods are interesting and the trail was easy. There was a wildfire nearby at our visit so several of the longer trails were closed. Currently they are having a new welcome center built so they are in a trailer, but I would not let that stop you from visiting. It made no difference to us. It is a very nice place to spend an hour or two. They also have a hut outback that opens after 1:00 where you can look at fossils under high powered microscopes which we all enjoyed looking at.

The lighting ceremony was a very patriotic time and well worth the time spent. It lasts around 30 minutes before the statue is lit with a ranger coming out and talking, and then a 20 minute video (weather permitting) on the history behind the presidents chosen for the monument. My suggestion is if you have young kids who are attending, make sure to bring along something for them to do if they get bored and be there early to get good seats. We hadn't realized there would be a program prior to the lighting so we were unprepared, but we got through it with 4 kids under 8 years old and it was well worth the experience.

After we got to the Visitor's Center, the Park Ranger was terrific. He first validated our parking ticket and then set us up on the next tour, which was on a trolley. We saw birth homes for both John Adams and John Quincy Adams. These were just 2 houses sitting on a corner with no signs to tell anyone what they are. We then were taken to a home that held 4 generations of John Adam's family. During the last part of the tour in the library, we were crammed into a small space with lots of people and neither of us could move. It made this part of the tour painful and very uncomfortable for both my husband and me. The park rangers gave the tours and I would have prefered a tour with more information given on the family and less on the artifacts in the homes. I realized my lack of information on this family and wanted a book to tell me more about their lives. One of the rangers in the visitor's center helped me choose some books to buy. Overall, this was a good experience and helps visitors learn about this important part of our country's history. I would recommend it to anyone. If you are 62, or older, get a park pass for $10 and thereafter every visit to a National Park will be free of charge.",

My husband said the tour was a little slow for him, but my teens did not complain. The guide was friendly, informative and patient as we had a group of Girl Scouts that were distracting. The nailhead formations were very cool and filled the cave. The most variety of rocks was in the formation room. We were able to be on two levels of the cave. The was an small area that had some of the box work that is described in the wind cave, so we got a little sampling of that. The tour started with going to 17 stories in an elevator first and then continued to walk down stairs and pathways. I didn't feel claustrophobic at all. But then I usually don't have a problem with that either. We called in advance for tickets like the reviews and NPS.com website suggested. (pay in advance too.) We got the scenic tour which took about an 1-1/2. When I picked up the tickets for the 1:20 tour, I over heard the Ranger say there next available tour was at 3:00. You can call 7 days in advance if you want too, but I think a one or two days would be fine. At least for June when it's a little less busy. Bring a sweatshirt because it's a consistent 49 degrees in the caves. We had just been horseback riding and had jeans on, so that worked out well. Most people had shorts and a sweatshirt. We brought fixings for lunch sandwiches and ate them on the shaded picnic tables. There where several around the parking lot. ",

The Lenape Native Americans first made use of the fall and later the Dutch in the 1690's. By 1793 the falls was used to develop mill works, locomoter works, and the Colt Revolver. All this history and more can be learned at the visitor center located adjacent to the falls or by visiting the Paterson Museum. The best views and photography can be had on the foot bridge over the falls, Haines Overlook Park on the south or Mary Ellen Kramer Park on the north. As of this date the National Park System has not developed the Great Falls area or Historic district so self-guided tours and free admission exist. The downside is that the Great Falls are in a troubled neighborhood. Once federal money is pumped into the park things should improve.",

Lowell's downtown still has many remnants from that time, though the mills have all shut down as the textile industry shifted first to the south and then to Asia. We found the National Historical Park visitor center and the sites they operate around the downtown to be a really good way get a feel for how Lowell grew and changed over time and why it is important to US history. It was so well done that even our children thought it was a great visit. The best thing to see is the Boots mill where they have a restored mill with a couple of hundred looms - some of which are operating. The noise and speed of these big looms is almost overwhelming. They provide free ear plugs. The boarding house and canal locks are also good. The visitor center gives you a map to use to follow the path between the sites. It is a fairly short walk.

BUY CHEAP RAIN PONCHOS IN THE CAMPING SECTION OF WALMART and keep them with you on your journey to the park!! Wear sturdy shoes or hiking boots. DO stop at the visitors center...there are park rangers there who will give you suggestions and a map based on your desired time in the park. NO lava, but plenty of steam!!! I was pleasantly surprised to discover an Army camp within the park... as my husband is active duty, we were able to eat in their cafe (at the camp bowling lanes)... Never saw the cashier ask for military ID, so I don't know if civilians could get away with eating there.... a phone call in advance could answer that. Otherwise, pack a lunch: not much 'civilization' out that way!!!",

One thing I would recommend is to go early and have breakfast with the Presidents at the Carvers Restautant. They have an open air deck and you can sit outside & look straight up at the Presidents while you eat. When we were there, we were the only ones sitting outside and it was a beautiful morning. You get a really great breakfast for $5.99 (The Monumental Breakfast - eggs, bacon, sausage & gravy and potatoes) - can't beat this deal and it was good! My other tip is right inside the entrance you can rent a hand held device for $5 and hear all of the background information as you walk the Presidential Trail. Wow, this is really an awe enspiring sight to see. I was there as a child and I thoroughly enjoyed going back!!",

We arrived just after 3:00 on a Saturday so we bought tickets for the last trolley tour at 4:00 then asked for a place to have a late lunch. We were told the nearby snack shop closed at 2:00 so we were directed to a small place not owned by the park behind the nearby Washington Memorial Chapel. It was cute, full of souvenirs and home made goodies. The lady there was happy to tell us about the church as we ate our hot dogs. We made it back just in time to hear a man speaking about events in Valley Forge, much of which I had no idea. It was very educational. There are many displays in the visitors center which we didn't have much time to look at. The tour was great, there was even men dressed in period clothing who gave a gun demonstration. Very interesting. I took many pictures I will try to post later. I would say the tour was very much worth the price of $15. But i would only reccommend it for older children since there is alot of sitting and listening and no seat belts. It was a great day, but next time we will be sure to go earlier, eat before we go or pack a nice lunch, there are plenty of places for a picnic. We plan to go back in the fall when the scenery will most surely be breathtaking. Visit their website for info and coupons before you go!

Saw no flowers in or near Bryce or Zion. The park rangers have a telescope set up so you can see the arch you might otherwise miss in the overwhelming beauty of the canyon. Unlike Bryce and Zion, which were crowded, even on the 4th of July there were always parking spots available at the overlooks at Cedar Breaks. If pressed for time, you can see a lot in an hour. At 10,000 feet, the cool air was a refeshing change from the heat of the other parks. Coming from the East Coast, the drive down to Cedar Creek was a bit of a white knuckle ride- would not attempt it in off weather but the views were literally breathtaking. If you're going to do several parks, buy the annual National Park Service pass for $80, which also gets you into national monuments like Cedar Breaks.",

We took a road trip in October, and thoroughly enjoyed the monument, the museum detailing it's history, and the really beautiful way the park was designed to feature the monument. Due to the cooler temps at that time of year, my elderly mom was not up for the Presidential Trail. Flash forward 9 months, and off I went again with my husband, adult children and their families, which includes a 9 yr. old. We all enjoyed the same things I had seen before, but added the Trail, which, as others mention, is a must see. There are some really wonderful views from lower vantage points, but do pay attention to the 'level of difficulty' signs, if you are typically sedentary. There are at least 2, and the \"strenuous\" trail is NOT difficult at all if you are in moderate shape, there are lots of stairs. The gift shop is LARGE and has something for every budget and taste. My mom and arrived at the park following the hwy from Custer City, my family and I entered from the Needles/Wind Cave area of Custer State Park taking Hwy 87. If you have the chance, choose the second route, it is SPECTACULAR, and you will get amazing glimpses of the monument before you arrive.",

It is by far nicer than any campground that we have seen in the Great Smokies National Park or on the Blue Ridge Parkway. If you are a hiker then you got to hike the 1.5 mile trail to Mount Pisgah where Channel 13 TV tower is located, The trial is a little streunous at the end but we did see people from ages 4 to 70 up at the obervation tower. The view from the top of Mount Pisgah is incredible and worth the hike. Buck Springs trail is another trail worth checking out! Mr. Vanderbilt of the Biltmore House had a hunting lodge there in the early 1900's. We also went to the Crade of Forestry and were skeptical of the $5 per person fee but we spent the day there and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Even transiting on I-5, taking a few extra hours out of your route to see the lake is worth it. While the full loop is nice, you can get a lot just by driving the north-south route that borders the lake. Visit the lodge area, and a few turnouts, then be on your way as you need. As well, if you have the time, schedule and take the lake boat tour. It is about 2 hours on a boat, touring around the lake and seeing things you cannot see from the crater wall. The hike to the boat is not easy - 1.1 miles, 700+ feet elevation. Think of climbing the stairs in a 65 story building. But take it slow if you need to. But if you do have the time, there is a lot to be seen on trials and it would be easy to spend several days soaking up the place. Any time the road to the lodge is open, it is worth seeing.",

My visit primarily focused on historical sights in the town, although I also enjoyed some nice scenic views, and I recommend visiting Jefferson's Rock for the beautiful view of the hills (but prepare to walk up a LOT of steps!).

It was difficult to hear the guides due to people being rude. There are stairs on this one and the website gives you details of tours and making reservations in advanced. The trog tour for 8-12 years old was great for my son. He talked and talked and new everything when we took our Historic tour. For only 1$ more than historic tour, you can take River Styx tour MAX of 40 people and it includes the whole Historic tour plus a bit more. Did I mention only 40 people. Make reservations in advanced or it may be full for you. Oh yeah, the Trog and River Styx leave early morning. The Historic is at different times all day. There are othere tours. Fat man's Misery, bottemless pits, and Tall man's Agony are on Historic tour. The Starlight chamber tour is easier walking it leaves at 6:30 at night 40 people using laterns. You see some of Historic but you see the chamber, wedding chamber, and some other things. The rangers are knowledgable. If you can do it take the tours with less people it is easier to hear the history if you care about that stuff. Wonderful to take my kids to where I went as a kid.",

We decided to see it at night and arrived around 8:30 for the 9:00 lighting ceremony. Many others arrive for this as well, so plan ahead if you attend to see this. We didn't get there early enough to get a seat at the auditorium for the ceremony. The experience at night would be best if you get a seat to see the movie that accompanies the speaker. We did not and it made the speech harder to follow without seeing the screen, especially for younger children like our 5 year old. While it was nice to see the mountain at night, the detail of the faces is better appreciated by day. We came back the next day to take it all in completely. The walk at the base of the mountain is easy and gets you up a bit closer. Overall, its worth the stop, especially for only $11 for a year, and for me makes me feel all the more American. Its an American Icon that shouldn't be missed if in the area.",

Guides did an excellent job of telling all participants of what to expect, when breaks would occur, what could go in the cave, what could come out, advised to consider personal health problems or limitations if they exist, and so on. Guides are very knowledgeable and share a lot of information. Lunch is available on this tour (extra charge) and was sufficient. There are two bathroom breaks on this tour. There are breaks at the top of steep ascents. The tour was fascinating and we saw amazing sights everywhere. This is a must if you are able and want a good long tour. Tour begins almost mid-way in the cave system and ends at Frozen Niagara. The second tour we booked was the River Styx tour. It is 2.5 miles long, 2.5 hours, does not include food options or bathroom breaks. It begins at the Historic Entrance of the caves, enters massive chambers, then into more narrow spaces that are not as tall as Grand Ave. tour. Tour meanders down to the underground river, finishes by exiting near Mammoth Tower (lots of steps). This tour is not as strenuous as the Grand Avenue tour, but there are plenty of steps and some hills. Both were fantastic and gave us a great view of most of the cave system. The River Styx tour focuses on the geology of the cave. ",

It was clean and very basic with no tv, radio, coffee, candy, water, magazines, or anything to suggest hospitality or comfort. Like a large outhouse with a bed in it. There was a ticking baseboard heater that was welcome on the cool evening in June that i stayed there. Unfortunately the smoke detector outside the room beeped and alarmed every 5 minutes all night, and i was unarmed. I decided to walk to the beautiful log cabin village restaurant for breakfast as a treat to start my day. I ordered a poached egg and it came on a white plate, all alone, cold and slimey and raw. After I gagged that down I ordered a nice warm \"home made\" cinnamon bun from the huge open gourmet kitchen that i could see and hear was staffed by a whole line of blue ribbon chefs. Over the banter of the line chefs and orders I heard the beeping of a microwave oven, but tried to remain optimistic. Eventually a plate arrived bearing a microwaved \"heat and eat\" premade bun that was dry outside, cold an dgoopy inside, and coated with weepy white icing from a tube. I was saddened, but even more so when I got my bill and saw the bun alone was $7. Tv chef ramsay would have asked them to turn in their aprons.",

In the dessert as you are driving along there are rock outcroppings interspersed throughout that jut out from the ground, yet none can equal El Morro. My husband said that the sheer sandstone cliffs at El Morro reminded me him of the glacial carved rock walls from Yosemite, although they are a totally different color. While visiting El Morro we learned that it had a constant and reliable source of water around the base of it which made it a very popular watering hole. Back in the day of horse and foot travel, El Morro's reliable water source was a Godsend. On El Morro's walls Ancestral Puebloans, Spanish, and American travelers carved their signatures, dates, messages and petroglyphs; ancient graffiti so to speak. The1/2 mile trail to the base of El Morro is paved and handicap accessible and reaches the lovely water pool. The 2 mile loop trail over the top of El Morro is well maintained, well marked and well worth the little extra time it takes to do it. The museum is free and the self-guided tour on the trails is $3.00 per adults, children 16 and under are free. The movie in the museum is a definite must for detailed information as to how, why, and when the ancient graffiti was created. The cliffs of El Morro up against the deep blue sky, and large, puffy white clouds of New Mexico is spectacular and without a doubt worth the 1 hour drive both ways to and from I-40.

I don't remember there being much more than a big parking lot with lots of trees in it and a visitor's center. It was a sculpture surrounded by nature. Now they have permanently scarred the area by building all this crap around it. There are restaurants (think $9 for a plain cafeteria burger), gift shops, an amphitheater. I think they are building all the stuff around it to compensate for the fact that all it is is a sculpture. If all you want is to see the faces, save yourself the $10 \"parking\" fee and look at it from outside. One thing I think is an improvement are the trails that let you walk all the way up to the base of the sculpture.

They said they couldn't sell me a ticket because the ticket guys were gone but they thought some were available the next day after 11 am. My husband left at 8:00 am. from our hotel to get tickets and found they had added an 8:30 am tour...which we could have taken if we were with him. He was then able to get tickets for 2:20 pm that day. I can't figure out why this is so difficult. We waited at Wind Cave for about 1 hour to go on a tour. It was so much better than going back 3 times to finally get in. I know the National Monuments may be under staffed but it seems more like lack of planning and organization. Why couldn't they just sell them first come first serve and then maybe it would be easier to get in if people weren't making phone reservations....???? Although I'm not sure who was making phone reservations if you can't get through. I'm glad the kids were able to see it so we don't have to do it again and go through the stress during our vacation. I'm not sure what I'd recommend. The ranger said many come and buy tickets and then come back a few days into their vacation. Many of us don't have the time to spare to do all the running around.

They are in the processing of building a visitor's center which looks like it will be really nice when finished. We got there a little late so we missed the fossil education in the Yurt (over at 3pm). All the staff was extremely nice and had alot of information to share. I don't know that it was so much about the fossils but more about the petrified redwoods for us. Be sure to catch one of the ranger's presentations down in the pavillion. They give alot of history about the area and information on what happened to the redwoods. We almost didn't go down to the homestead but the kids forced me and it was worth it. The volunteer did a great job telling us he history of the homestead and pointing out little things that we missed. All in all I think this is probably an easily missed placed to visit but well worth it if you're in to fossils and VERY LARGE petrified redwoods. Fee is minimal....only $3 per person over age 16.",

This park really takes into consideration everything that you might think of. They are environmentally conscious, have very good food selections too. It is a great place to sit in the open space and read a book or listen to your MP3 player. Then you can reflect on the beauty of this sculpture. I strongly recommend everyone do the audio tour which will share a lot of insider tidbits with you. Without the audio you will miss so much about the history of the location and the people's stories along with it and might be tempted to say this was 'boring'. We arrived at 11am and didn't leave until 4pm. I truly didn't think the day would fly by so quickly. The gift shop offers some amazing items Made in the USA also. A nice touch given everything imported from overseas nowadays. Treat yourself to an American piece of history. PS all you pay is $11 for parking and you get to use the pass for 1 year.",

We were in the park on July 3 and got to participate in some of the Independence Day activities. Even though the park was full, parking was painless and access to bathroom facilities and concessions was easy with very little wait. While I wouldn't plan more than a few hours in the park, we had a great time going through the museums at the welcome center and hiked up to a view Rushmore from a different vantage point. We packed a picnic lunch and ate before we got to the park, but had AWESOME Raspberry soft serve ice cream cones. We didn't travel with kids, but saw many taking part in the awesome \"Junior Ranger Program\". Would definitely be fun for kids ages 6-11 or so. There was an $11 parking fee, but no fee to enter the park. I think they discouraged outside food and drink, but we each carried a bottle of water in without any problems.",

        "text": "We camped at Diamond Lake which is only about 14 miles from Carter Lake with our 10 year old twins. The bugs there were horrible but I will save that for another review. We went to Crater Lake on a Monday so it wasn\u2019t too crowed. I have been to several national parks and would have to say this was the most accessible park yet. They charge a $10 entrance fee per car. The view points are not far from each other and very easy to get to. The parking was easy also. I would not recommend traveling with an RV since there isn\u2019t really any RV parking at the view points. They do have a trolley you can take if you don\u2019t want to drive. If you are travelling during the summer all the roads Should be open and you can drive all the way around the crater which I would definitely recommend. If you get nervous with driving near cliffs be aware for a good portion of the drive around the lake there are cliffs right at the edge of the pavement. I was very nervous but made it through. We drove very slowly on those parts. One day is plenty of time to spend at the crater if you don\u2019t plan to take long hikes. The mosquitoes were pretty bad so bring plenty of spray and wear long sleeves and pants. We ended up eating our picnic lunch in the car because of the bugs. We decided to take a boat tour. Since we didn\u2019t book tickets in advance we were able to go to a kiosk at the lodge to purchase tickets. We weren\u2019t sure if we could get tickets, but they did still have some for the same day on a late afternoon tour. The hike to the boat launch is 2.2 miles round trip with a 700 ft. elevation and is marked strenuous. This is very similar to the hike for Multnomah Falls in the Columbia Gorge, OR. You need to take into consideration the elevation and the weather for this hike at Crater Lake. I get pretty nervous with heights. Three out of four of us slipped on the way down. The trail is dirt and small rocks which makes it very slippery and dusty. We held the hands of our kids the whole way. It took us about 25 minutes to get down and about 45 to get back up. The tour cost $108 for the four of us. It was two hours long and drove very slowly around the perimeter of the lake. They have a park ranger who tells the different theories of how the lake formed on board of the tour. Most of these facts you will read at the view points and you can see nearly everything from the view points. It was a very slow tour. The kids and I were bored and ready to go after about an hour of it. You must bring plenty of water and food for this tour. The bathrooms were disgusting (out houses). I would bring some TP with you just in case. I could have lived without this tour. I would not recommend this excursion to families with children 10 or younger. Driving around the crater and stopping at the view points was good enough for me. The lake is beautiful and I was able to get some gorgeous pictures.",

I would also suggest if you go in the summer to buy what is known as FROGG TOGGS. I found mine at Bed Bath and Beyond. Read how to prepare the cooling cloth. This is a neck wrap in a plastic bottle that you wet and wear when you get hot. It saved me from over heating and kept me cool. If you are older take the steps slowly and walk slowly and rest often. Take water and drink as you go. The walk in front of the memorial is worth it. The beauty of the landscape is unreal. You see pictures and movies of Mt.

The Visitors' Center is well done, as is the gift store. Our grandsons became Junior Rangers and the Park Ranger made the 'ceremony' quite nice by really checking their work, administering an 'oath', presenting certificates and badges, and giving congratulatory handshakes. We, too, were initially dismayed at the admission fee, but in retrospect, decided it was more token monetary support to the upkeep of the battlefield than any true financial hardship. At $10 a car, you really can't complain. There was a small demonstration of the way infantry troops advance presented at the center. And while there were only four soldiers, they did a nice job showing troop movement. The movie was quite informative. The small exhibition area was well done and the artifacts well chosen.

Of course, this is probably the most underwhelming of all the national parks in the country (mind you, I have been to only two and just seen pictures of the rest !). Still, it provides some nice hikes (the Ledges trail is a must do here), and a wonderful biking route following the Cuyahoga river. If you have your own bike, you can ride as far as you wish and then take the scenic railroad back (tickets are $2 if you have a bike, $17 if you do not !!). If you rent, on the other hand,as we did, then you have to meticulously plan your schedule to catch the train. Otherwise, you can end up paying quite a bit since rentals are $9/hr. There are a couple of quaint little towns here, and we happened to run into an enjoyable farmer's market in Peninsula, OH on a beautiful day. Also, it is really close to Cleveland. So, if you get a little bored, you can easily go spend some time in the city. Overall, a really nice getaway for a day or two. ",

Then onto Rapid City and Keystone. The drive from Rapid City to Keystone wasn't bad at all. I took off early in the morning so there wasn't a lot of crazy traffic. As you're driving up the winding roads, all of a sudden BOOM there it is. Of course it looks smaller from this distance but everyone gets out and takes a picture. The smell of pine trees is wonderful. Then onto the Visitor Center. $11 entrance fee was well worth it. Lots of parking (several outdoor levels). Then a nice walk up to the main plaza. There's a very long row of flags for every state in the union. A great gift shop and cafe. And the sight of the presidents up close is truly breathtaking. Just the sheer human achievement of actually getting something that huge and detailed carved into a mountain side is truly awe-inspiring. I couldn't stop looking at them. Don't miss it.

The staff said that it was a slow-ish day there, but with the crowds of people, I would hate to be there on a busy day. I would have liked to see more history of the presidents depicted in the monument. Being a foreigner, I have never taken any American History courses, but I felt like I walked away learning more about the sculpture than the men he so carefully crafted. Having something like a rock carving demonstration or more interactive exhibits of the construction of it would have been nice. We only spent about 2 hrs there, and then came back at night for the illumination ceremony which was a disappointment. They basically just played the same video that loops in the exhibit hall, and slowly turned the lights on. Unless you're already there, I wouldn't go back there for that part. It would also have been nice if there was a restaurant on site, not just a burger-shack. We were pretty burger'd out by that point on a road trip. I'm glad I went once, but it wasn't the highlight of my trip.",

If you have time, try walking a little of the paths to some of the national landmark homes that might not be open but this offers a serene retreat to contemplate these historic events. The NPS just does a terrific job of educating the public about our parks. I have a National Parks pass but this is free.",

BUT given the huge amount of money spent to restore the building it's a real shame the standard of presentation is so weak. When we last came ten years there was a coloured panel that helped you pick out the jumbled bones of each animal by using a different colour for each one. Now there's very little to help you understand what's going on - just a couple of well-intentioned rangers, a few basic information panels, a $1 kids' booklet, and very little else. The truth is that you are looking at a large grey cliff face scattered with a large number of disarticulated grey bones, some of which are quite a long way above you and it's very hard to make sense of, especially for kids who are probably expecting something far more dramatic. None of the skeletons is complete which means you are looking at a stack of vertebrae here, a bit of tail there, a couple of leg bones over there and so on. This is a place that is screaming out for a presentation video, better labelling of the bones and so on. Ironically, the wall displays of skeleton plaster casts are considerably more informative and easier to understand. We came a long way to see this and we were in and out of the cover building in about 30 minutes and that was stretching it. In some respects the 1.5-mile trail back to the parking lot (you have to come up to the quarry by shuttle) which takes you past an open-air section of the quarry with bones in place was more evocative. So, it's undeniably worth visiting and very memorable but I had the feeling it could with some time, trouble, and money, be a lot better.",

This area is full of flowers and the lake is wonderful. I continued down and saw the largest moose I have every saw. It had 8 points but another 10-12 points that were about to complete. A sight. The South fork Cascade was fully of waterfalls and cliffs. Going to the end and climbing Hurricane Pass is well worth it to see the perfect view of the 3 Tetons and the valley where the South Fork Trail runs. I stayed two days in this area. Well work it.

I had read on the reviews prior to coming that a new phone reservation system will be coming. I recommend offering an internet reservation option as well, similar to the state park's system, so people can get immediate results about availability. The reservation line was a frustation.",

Our family really enjoyed the walking trail, which is nicely done with walkways and railings. Muliple steps but easily navigated, and it provided a closer view of the faces. Also enjoyed the little building below that houses the sculptor's model and some factual information. Although I love the improvements made with the avenue of flags and the columns and granite walkway and grand entrance to the monument, I was disappointed to see the associated artifacts and pictures and factual information about the formation of the monument is no longer on site. Instead there is a restaurant. There is also a gift shop. The fee was only $11 to get in, so a real value to enjoy the beauty of this majestic monument nestled in the beautiful black hills.",

The rangers will provide free flashlights for cave exploration, and you will need them, because the caves are not lighted at all. Great short hikes abound. Be sure to have sun protection if you plan to hike, because there is very little shade, mostly juniper trees. Bring food and water as well. The caves are amazing and some of them easy to do with families and children. Good idea to bring a helmet to avoid ceiling bumps. Interesting history, too, and some of the trails provide history lessons in addition to the fascinating geology of the place.

At the visitor's center you can view a short video that depicts the events plus get your map, visit the bookstore, etc. The park itself has a number of walking trails that wind throughout. There are also numerous unit markers, memorials, and stands that explain the battle. I suggest doing a little reading before hand to get a full picture of the events, or use one of the many audio tours available. Markers are quite as good as Gettysburg, but plenty of explanation and identification of units. The map lays out a pretty good driving route from North to South. Be sure to step out into the cornfield as well as the sunken road and Burnside Bridge (all must see areas). You can probably drive around in an hour if in a hurry. I wandered for 3 hours and didn't see everything. Admission is free for active military.",

There were no reenactments going on but it was stil a good visit. But if you have trouble walking keep in mind that it is alot of walking, some of it up hill and on very old steps. Parking is limited in the main town and it is much easier to take the frequent shuttle down from the visitors center. You pay by person but per car rate is cheaper if you are a couple. The pass is good for 3 days. We drove from exit 29 Hagerstown MD and it took us about 30 minutes to get to it.

There's a good film (if maybe a bit overwrought) you shouldn't miss. The displays in the center are very good. I thought the display showing the progess of the wave by using lights was especially helpful in understanding how quickly and how far the wave traveled. You can see remnants of the dam from the Center so you don't necessarily need to go anywhere but the Center but there are other vantage points around the lake for those wanting a closer look. One thing I was not happy to learn is the park's naturalist has advocated for letting the lake bed grow back vegetation so the valley will eventually look as it did before the dam was built. Apparently, this is the path the Park Service is taking, after years of cutting back brush so visitors can see the extent of the lake. I feel that once the valley has grown back there will be nothing to show visitors other than pictures. What would be the point of the Memorial after that? Why keep funding a Park site commemorating an event if the site no longer looks like it did at the time of the event? So if you're interested in learning about the flood and seeing what's left of the site after the flood you should go sooner rather than later.

Would of been nice to stay at Crater Lake, but like most national parks, the lodge (on national register) and cabins book up months in advance, especially the three months of the year the area is not covered under several feet of snow. Approaching the park from the south is on a two lane blacktop road climbing up through a lot of countryside. Make sure you fill up the tank, because there are not many amenities until you reach the volcanic rim. Beautiful scenery, clean spruce-smelling air, but warm in August (hit 90 degrees when we were there). $10 admission per carload or use your golden pass. Very popular so cars get backed up at the entrance. We were traveling with our beagle and disappointed we couldn't take her on any of the trails, but dogs are allowed on one closed road and all the public areas. Beautiful views of the lake from several places along the circle rim drive, but the best are from the walkway at the rim village. Lots of events on the weekend. We had to pass several cyclists, and there were a hundred plus runners doing the loop early in the morning. Several waterfalls, one right by the east loop road. There is a boat trip on the lake that allows you time to explore Wizard island in the crater, but it takes several hours. Camping available and trams if you don't want to do the drive yourself. We took the north exit to the park and headed back on SR 138 to the I-5, also a scenic highway right along the beautiful, trout-filled North Umpqua river.",

We started our tour at the National Park headquarters in Quincy. It was a little tricky to park and find the HQ, but it was highly worth the effort and the small fee for the trolley, which takes you to three homes, the first two homes of John and Abigail Adams, and the home of John Quincy Adams. All three are meticulously maintained and are hosted by knowledgeable guides. Make sure you plan your timing right, as there's a time limit with the trolleys. I was disappointed that we couldn't take pictures inside, particularly at the library at Peace Field - it was spectacular! Make sure you go to the United First Parish Church in Quincy to see where they are interred - that tour is offered by members of the parish for donations, and gives the visitor a true sense of awe for our founding fathers and mothers.",

I didnt see anyone fall or even come close to that. you do want to make sure you use the restroom facilities before going... checking that your kids do too!(our 8 year old was really, really wanting to get to the surface after about 1 hour!)

I highly recommend a helmet (I used mine several times). Bring gloves and knee pads if you want to really explore.

Don't get me wrong, it is still amazing and definitely worth a visit. On this trip we included the evening program at Mount Rushmore because we had heard that it was very beautiful with the monument lighting ceremony which was begun at 8 P.M. Actually, the entire ceremony lasted about 90 minutes. It started with a history talk by the ranger at the beginning, then the lighting ceremony & patriotic music, and lastly, a call for all veterans to come to the stage to be recognized by their name, rank, and service affiliation. As you can imagine, this took a long time. There were many families with young children & I think they were getting a little antsy by the conclusion - if you have young ones, I would recommend leaving before the vets portion of the program. The monument is free but the cost of parking is $11.00. Be sure to remember where you parked your vehicle - yes, it took us a while to find ours! If you go at night, I would recommend staying nearby in Keystone as it was about a 30 minute drive in the dark back to our Rapid City motel. Keep in mind that there are many deer nearby & in the roads at nightfall, so the drive can seem longer than it actually is!",

The park tourguides themselves were also on hand and very knowledgable and animated in their presentations. The drive tour is free and you can access info at each stop via cellphone. Or you can purchase a more detailed driveguide via cd for about $15. Very similar to Gettysburg. Their is also plenty of areas for cycling walking running picnicking and a host of other outdoor activities. Washington chapel is on the tour but is not part of the NPS and the church charges a $2 admission fee..well worth the small donation. The architecture is fantastic and the folks providing info about the church know their stuff. Even in the pouring rain ( which it did for most of our visit) you can still enjoy the entire area.

The hike was not far (less than one mile for sure) and when we got to the cave, it felt like it had air conditioning!! We didn't want to get out. The upper half of the cave was blocked off though because bats are still hybernating in there. There are concrete steps inside the cave. The cave itself was nothing spectacular; just more like a vertical cave where you see a little bit of water. We didn't get our shoes wet at all, but I think that's because we went in the summer. We drove back to King City for lunch and went to Balconies Cave (west entrance) in the afternoon. There is a brand new visitor's center at this entrance. Since we've already paid the admission when we went in throught the east entrance, we didn't have to pay again. (I think the ranger drives around the parking lots to check if you have the receipt taped to your window). You need to take the road going to the Balconies Cave trail all the way to the end where there is a parking lot. I can't remember if there was a permanent restroom there or porta-potties....I am leaning towards porta-potties. The hike was also less than one mile, and the Balconies Cave did not feel air-conditioned like the other one. However, I found this cave more interesting. There are many huge rocks (some very round) which have fallen from above and have gotten stuck, forming the talus cave. Some portions of this cave are quite dark, so you should have a flashlight. At a couple of spots, you really have to climb up/down by stepping on rocks. The climbs are short though, probably less than 8 feet. We did not encounter any bugs or insects or snakes inside the cave. The cave is not long, just right for little adventurers. If you have an agile kid, I think an 8 yr. old will do fine, but make sure it's the dry season. Some of the rocks can get pretty slippery if wet. From King City, both entrances are a little bit over an hour away. You cannot drive from one entrance to the other....but you can hike across (they say it'll take you a few to several hours). If you want to visit both entrances, I think King City is the best place to stop for a bite to eat. There are no restaurants at the park. At the east entrance, two people manned the visitor's center; at the west entrance, one person manned the visitor's center. Oh, and there is no cell phone reception for T-Mobile or Verizon at the park. However, I was told that along the road before you turn into the east visitor's center, there is reception for another carrier...maybe AT&T?",

About three hundred & fifty miles from Denver by way of Tennessee Pass, this is a wonderful relatively not well known Nat. Park. The South Rim entrance is a short drive from the main hwy.& what a surprise. Similiar to the Grand Canyon in depth, but the magnificence of the sheer walls of multi colored rock far surpasses anything in the Grand Canyon. Very well kept roads, very clean restrooms throught out the park & Rangers who were very helpful with information. You can drive down to the bottom of the Canyon, but the drive is posted as 16% grade & it looked to be more than that in several places, its not for the faint of heart as my co-pilot said.. There are plenty of Motels in Gunnison & Montrose to accomodate any size party & reasonably priced.

We stopped at the Visitors Center, which is just inside the park gates. We looked around a bit and picked up a map. Then we hit the road. We headed down Crater Rim Drive first, toward the Jaggar Museum. On the way, we stopped to check out the Steam Vents (easy walk from the parking area). It was really odd to see steam coming from the earth like that. This is where we got our first look at the Kilauea Crater\u2026you can see it in the distance from a little viewing area near the vents. After our first look at the crater, we were so excited to see it closer!! We headed to the Jaggar Museum (when we visited on 11/11/10, Crater Rim Drive was closed beyond the Jaggar Museum). We got out of the car and walked toward the museum. This is the only place during our entire trip where we detected a sulfur-like smell in the air. Certainly not overpowering in any way - and once you pass the National Park sign for the museum, the smell went away. We walked around the museum to check out the displays. They have a bunch of huge rolls of paper behind a glass wall which appear to be tracking seismic activity all over the area. They also have some samples of lava for you to check out. There is also a small Vistors Center where you can pick up some souvenirs. Don\u2019t plan to eat here \u2013 there is no food or drink. Then, the big moment\u2026.we walked over to the viewing area and there it was\u2026.the Kilauea Crater!! There was a vent in the crater with steam pouring out constantly (thankfully the steam was heading away from the viewing area). As of our visit, there was no visible, flowing lava here\u2026.just steam. But it is an amazing view. According to one of the rangers that was walking around, the lava is about 150 feet below the surface. I could have just starred at it for days. But, we didn\u2019t have days\u2026.so we left the Jaggar and came back down Crater Rim Drive, heading back towards the Visitors Center and the Park Entrance. ",

Two tour guides took us through 2 miles of cave and we saw stunning caverns, long low-lit passageways with fallen boulders, odd little crevices that we had to climb down into and shimmy through, and deep, dark holes with \"waterfalls\" that rose back up to the surface. Practically anyone could do this tour. An older woman in her seventies was in front of us and she struggled a little with the area that we had to duck down to pass through but otherwise she was fine.

We bought the $20 CD but found that it was not possible to tell which of the tour stops (numbered on a map) each CD track was talking about, so we ended up not using the CD and wasting our $20. Also, the website said that they encourage people to walk or bike on the self-guided tour, but there is no walking/biking path - one has to walk or bike on the very narrow road used by cars, which would be dangerous ( We saw nobody walking or biking). Also, along the self-guided car tour, there are many roadside signs explaining what had gone on at that part of the battlefield, but these signs were far from the parking areas, and it would have been dangerous to walk on the narrow road from the parking area to the signs. The road was too narrow to park near the signs in order to read them - we would have blocked traffic if we had done so. Very poorly planned out site from the visitor point of view.",

Although all of the Utah national parks relate to the geology of the Colorado Plateau, each one has been preserved because it is different. Capitol Reef is newer (1971) than its national park siblings in the state and, by comparison, suffers from the fact that it is huge and doesn't have as many well marked vistas that you can drive to and take a picture at. Not that it doesn't have absolutely stunning views, but they aren't the great amphitheaters of Bryce or the temples of Zion. The majesty of Capitol Reef is the fact that it is literally a hundred miles long! Some tour guides mention that it is better appreciated from the air than at ground level. Although many people probably just stop at the visitor center and then continue across the park on Route 24, you won't appreciate the geology nearly as much unless you drive on at least a portion of the scenic drive. It's only from the drive that you can truly see the extent of the cliffs that are the primary feature of the park. If time is limited you don't have to drive the entire distance; it's only a $5 fee so it's not a big expense even for a shorter drive. When you do drive across on Rt24 be sure to stop at the petroglyphs; they are the easiest to get to ones we've found anywhere in the SW.",

There is a small charge to park at the monument ($11, for a car), but the actual admission is free. You can see the monument as you get closer to it while driving which kind of makes it less exciting when you arrive. The memorial looks just like you expect it to look. There is a nice easy to use walkway that circles the area with information about the monument and different view points, but you can't really get that close to the sculpture. We stayed for the lighting ceremony and while I thought the presentation was nice I was expecting much more. It was a cool sight to see, but once you've seen it I don't know if you'll ever need to go back (I know I won't). There is a cafe with typical cafeteria foods (burgers, chicken, etc.), drinks, an ice cream shop, and a gift shop. Everything is overpriced but that should be expected.

Crater Lake itself is an amazing site, plus there are spectacular views of the surrounding mountains on a clear day. We took a two-day Amtrak trip to Crater Lake (and Klamath Falls), so we did not have a car to get to the lake. Instead we used the Crater Lake Trolley to get up to the lake (about 1 hour ride) and to take the tour around the rim. It was outstanding. A volunteer National Park guide boarded the trolley and provided excellent information for two hours about Crater Lake, its history, and the geology. We made many stops to view the scenery and learn about prominent points. The cost of the rim tour was $22 for seniors and was worth every penny. The lodge is beautiful and worth exploring also. Although we didn't have time to hike, there are many trails of varied length and difficulty. One could easily spend a full day exploring this treasure.",

The Visitor Center offers a short film that is worth watching and also has many artifacts in an exhibit downstairs. I suggest seeing both before you set off on your tour. If you want a bit more history, go to the back viewing room (huge windows giving you a bird's eye view of the countryside and battle fields) where a ranger or docent will narrate and answer questions. The center provides you with a map that clearly shows roads and places to park your car for those that want to get out and read one of the many plaques posted throughout the park. There are so many statues, markers, monuments dedicated by various states and civil war divisions that it is overwhelming! Beautiful, but sad. Length of stay is totally up to the visitor. Go as fast or as slow as you like. Roads clearly marked. Restrooms available. Handicap accessible in places. There is a fee. (Do not forget to visit the National Cemetery in Sharpsburg. Parking free.

Our 5 miles turned into 15 as we kept making left turns to see what was down that path into the woods. We ended up discovering wonderful 200 year old houses & farms, maintained by the park, and completely off the beaten path. I understand why the Park does not advertise these beauties, they are not set up for tourists, but if you love old houses and the feeling of being in a place that hasn't changed in 200 years try foraging through the woods to find these spots! There are trail maps,(for when you go off the 5 mile trail), that are NOT well marked, but they do generally tell you where these spots are.

One warning--if you are going to stay for the evening lighting ceremony (which I HIGHLY recommend), BE SURE to take a jacket or sweatshirt. It gets pretty chilly in that outdoor amphitheater, even in warm weather! It lasts for about 45-60 minutes and consists of singing, presidential trivia, and a video.

The Park has beautiful trails for hiking and biking. This is the first National Park I've visited where dogs are welcome on the trails -- I wished I'd known that ahead of time. There is an excellent option where bike riders with their bikes can hop the CVSR train for $2 and get dropped off at a distant train stop to ride the trail back to their cars. Interesting history on the Ohio canal. Cool waterfalls. The Farmers Market at Howe Meadow on Saturday morning was the BEST market I visited this year. We brought home apples, potatoes, zucchini, squash, raspberries, tomatoes, and goat's cheese. Yum! Yum! Yum! Overall, a nice place to visit for a long weekend.",

The parking fee was suppose to be temporary but the NPS must think that no one will notice the high price (we locals are not stupid). If you have not been there- it is well worth the visit- after that there are other places in the Black Hills that provide a much better family experience. The concession food is nasty (steam cafeteria style) and if you are truly starving to eat then go for it. Much better in Hill City and Keystone.

It was a great experience, we are not Americans but as ever we were highly impressed by the nationalistic fervour of Americans. The Memorial is a well constructed and organized place for visitors, with lots of information about the creating of the sculpture, and the evening lighting of the mountain was spectacular. It is a gentle up hill walk from the parking area so even older folks should be able to make the trip. It cost us $11 for parking when we went in the late-morning and that ticket was still valid when we returned for the night show. Nearby Keystone through which we passed but didn't stay looked very interesting with numerous small stores and eating places and some nice looking hotels. The surrounding Black Hills area is beautiful and the scenic drives over the \"pigtail bridges\" and through some very narrow tunnels along the Needles highway were nothing short of spectacular.

I have been going to this park from the time I was pre teen and that was in the 1950s. I have seen a lot change as time passed. But the main item, the cave still remains the best part. We took a light tour of four hours and viewed some of the History of the cave and heard stories and History from a very special guide. Our Guide was a direct decendent of the three original guides from over a hundred years ago. On our tour we viewed the large passages and areas where products used to make gun powder were mined. We also did some twisty cruves and climbing that was hard at times. But we survived and had a great time. Staying at the Park has many levels. In the past I have stayed in cabins that were very low end in price, and once in the big lodge that was high end on price. My favarite was the old Hotel now torn down. Food options are good with a reasonable priced full service resturant to a modern snak bar service. The full sevice resturant has a good but basic menu and is based on country family type foods. All very good and filling. Little stores abound to see any type of Tenn or cave rememberance there is. This is a more than one day and less than two day for a quick visit but my recomedation is to stay for three nights. That was one can enjoy a day under and a day over on a trail or river visit. They have a web site for information and it can be helpful but if you travel like me, it will serve only as a guide. If your going to stay in park you MUST secure the room, if not you will pay $$. The entire staff down to the kitchen staff have a very friendly attitude and seem to be sure to make the visit a good one. In my youth i used to do \"wild\" caving or spelunking as it is called. You can do some wilder caving here but need to be in much better shape than I am now. Go, enjoy, and experence wild America.",

We drop off the bags and headed over tot he memorial as it was becoming dusk and at the memorial they have a lightning ceremony where as the sun sets and gets darker, they off lights and tell you the history of Mt Rushmore. As they finish up -they ask everyone to stand and join in with reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and then the monument is light up starting from the bottom. Visitors try to gather around the stone edge to look down into the amphitheater to see what is going on there. As much as this might be interesting, if you want good pictures, hang back a little for pictures. As for Carver's Cafe, if you want a snack then grab a bit here before it closes.

The only way to see one of the springs is to go to one of the Bath Houses and pay to take a bath in it. My 8 1/2 year old and I didn't have the time to do that, so we toured the National Park building and saw all of the old tubs, recreational faciltiies and learned a lot of history without ever seeing a hot spring. It was a side trip on our way home from Texas to Ohio and I am glad to say we have seen another National Park, but it wasn't really worth the added time or expense. Just a word worth noting: there was a sign in the Welcome Center that said the building was going to be closed soon for remodeling so I would call ahead to see if it is open or not.",

The only other place on earth like it is somewhere in Turkey. Bryce is technically not a canyon, because there is no river. We went to Bryce for the hiking. We went in the fall so as to avoid the summer crowds, but it turned out to be busy then too, with older people (like us) and foreigners. I didn't think it was too bad, and because we did some of the more difficult hikes, we saw fewer people. There is a shuttle system in the park, but you can also use your car if there is room in the parking lots. We had no problem with that and did both. The in-park lodge is very nice, but we were happy with our less-expensive accommodations at the nearby Bryce Canyon Pines. I would also recommend the free narrated bus tour, which we did the first day to get the lay of the land. You sign up at the Visitors Center. I thought this park was the more unique of the two we visited this trip (we also went to Zion). Pay attention to weather averages because it can be colder here because of the elevation (8,000 feet), also be aware that elevation can cause problems if you are not prepared for it. Most of the viewing of Bryce is from the rim, but you can hike down into the canyon as well. If you are a senior citizen you can buy a Golden Pass, giving you free entry to all national parks. I would also suggest spending several days here. We spent three days.",

All of the trails are interesting and you are virtually guaranteed to see petroglyphs at them all. It is very interesting to scan the rocks, locate the petroglyphs, and think about someone carving the figures in the volcanic rock long ago. It provided a pretty cool connection to the past and I thought it was well worth the visit. Be aware though that this is a fairly low-key activity and people with little to no interest in history may actually find it boring. The only cost is $1.00 per vehicle.

Finally, when the ranger goes over the physical demands of the tour - trust that there is no exaggeration and if you don't feel up to it, choose a different tour. Your fellow visitors will appreciate it :-)",

The experience was very enlightening. Johnson was obviously something of an outsider in Washington -- rough and unsophisticated by Eastern standards yet his outsized ego, ability to read people and his uncanny political acumen elevated him to the presidency. Here, in his element, you see him, warts and all, as the larger than life figure he was. You can see and undersatnd the hard-scrabble beginnings and the over-the-top showmanship he developed at the height of his power. The old, tired 50's furnishings of the \"whitehouse\" contrast starkly with the airplane hanger he had built. The big cars and lavish gifts all were part of his \"texas\" persona. Its' all fascinating and it's all here. Our NPS tour guide was very good, knew a few stories to pass along and painted a well-rounded, even sympathetic, portrait of the president my generation helped driver from office in 1968.",

        "text": "I decided on this particular route after talking to some of the rangers at the Summit Visitor Center for advice. Their recommendations and warnings were spot on so I would like to pass them on to you. If you want to do some amazing hiking after watching the unreal sunrise at the summit and are in good physical condition I would highly recommend the circuit listed in the title. First obtain a trail map from the park rangers in the Summet Visitor Center. Next drive your vehicle down to the trailhead for the Halemau'u Trail. This will be about 3.5 miles from the Summit Visitor Center. The reason for doing this is to have your vehicle where you finish your hike so you won't have to try to hitch a ride back to the Summit Visitor Center at the end of the day. You will be tired, sore and very dirty! Once you leave your vehicle in the parking lot of the Halemau'u trailhead go to the main road up leading up to the Summit. There is a designated area that you can hitchhike a lift back up to the summit. You may have seen the sign for \"Hiker pick up when you were making your way up. This may take awhile as no tourists want to pick up hitch hikers nowadays but someone will. I waited 30 min before a couple of local guys doing dry wall at the Science center picked me up. Get dropped off at the Summit Visitor center and the trailhead to the Keonehe'ehe'e Trail (aka Sliding Sands) is to the right. The is the start of your 11 to 12 mile journey so be prepared with fluids and warm clothing! The first leg of the journey will be about 4 miles and will take you to the floor of the crater. There will be a junction where a single large yellow flower bush is that is populated by a million wasps (so take care). Here you then cross the basin desert to the base of one of the cinder cones. Again you will come to a junction where you can either go left (the sign with say around take an extra 0.4 mile tour around the cinder cone by going right. This is what I did and I would recommend it as the views are worth it. While circling the cinder cone you will hit the Halemau'u trail. Kawilinau is the \"bottomless pit\" that you will see surrounded by a fence. Continue your counterclockwise journey around the cinder cone along the Halemau'u trail towards Holua cabin. En route you can take the short silversword loop. Beautiful rare plants that you propably already saw plenty of while decending so it can be skipped in my opinion. You will see the Holua cabin and their is an outhouse here for a bathroom break if need. There is also water but you need to treat it first to make it drinkable. Rest up and the final leg to the Halemau'u trailhead is next. The first half is no problem. You may see some hikers coming in the opposite direction which I thought would be unpleasant as they are hiking with the sun directly in their sight. The worst part of the circuit is unfortunately at the end. You have to climb up the mountain via multiple switchbacks. The view is great but it can take around 1 to 1.5 hours depending on how many breaks you take. After 10 or so miles of hiking the last think you probably want to do is ascend a 2000 ft but better to do this between 7000 and 8000 feet vs the opposite direction which would be 10000 ft at the summit! I started the journey at 7:45 am. It took me 6 hours and 15 min to complete. I saw a total of 6 people only so don't worry about crowds. I took hundreds of pictures and stopped 2 or 3 times for 10 minutes each. My Jeep was waiting for me and I was so happy I didn't have to hitchhike back up to the summit. You'll sleep like a baby that night! Good luck.",

You'll end up taking it home in the car, ears and mouth. There are no running streams except for a few muddy rifles in Chaco Wash. A good place for biking and hiking, suggesting hiking if you want to see all the scattered artifacts and pueblo housing. The easiest are hugging Chaco Wash, but there's more to see on top of the mesas which are easy climbs. The trip in can be made easily with a touring vehicle, but be weary of rain and or snow fall that melts during the day....the chances of getting stuck on the road in-between civilized areas will be high...whether you have 4 wheel drive or not. The park tends to like the dirt road in and out because it does not allow traffic like Yellowstone. Pueblo architecture is first rate...right up there with Mesa Verde. It is obvious these people were excellent farmers and they thrived when the climate allowed, but as usual with all ancient cultures, climate change brought them down and the place has not been taken apart by the next culture that came in, so it's still somewhat complete and intact and a great place to get that real feel for pueblo culture in the southwest.",

I know lots of people do an in and out in one day but there's so much more to see and learn than that kind of schedule permits. The walking tours from the Visitor Center are a terrific way to get acclimated. Then you can take off on your own, stepping out of time to be with those who came before.

Then to the museum and another hike around the park and explore steam vents. Then nightfall and the show starts with the glow of the lava. It is surreal and hypnotic!

Even if you only have one day, the fee is worth it. Start at the visitor center. There you can find out about current activity, ranger talks, get maps of the park and check out the gift shop. I would then take the Crater Rim Drive. This road currently only goes as far as the Jagger Museum due to the activity in Halema'uma'u Crater. Along the road there are several places to stop with great views of the Kilauea Caldera and some short hikes. The other drive is Chain of Craters. The map suggests a driving time of 3 hours and this is pretty accurate if you spend a short amount of time at all the pull offs. The road starts near the visitor center and winds up down at the coast. There are stops at a lava tube, Devastation Trail, petroglyphs, craters, old lava flows and the coast. You can walk to the end of the road where the 2003 lava flow went over. From this side you can also hike the 15 miles to the current flow activity or drive south of Hilo and take a shorter 2 mile hike in the afternoon. There are lots of longer hikes in the park and other roads up Mauna Loa. The thing I liked most about the park was the diversity of the landscape. You have tropical plants and barren lava flows, tall peaks and crashing waves. All this in one national park. There is a small store in the lodge that sells sandwiches and salads, but I would suggest eating in Volcano Village where you get more for the price. It was misty and cool in the park, but the sun peaked out at times and it was sunny and warm down at the end of the Craters Road. Prepare for a variety of weather and don't let it hamper your visit.

The \"Historic Tour\" was exactly that- facts about history. It doesn't show the \"prettier\" parts of the cave, but it does offer some interesting facts about earlier cave tours. The \"New Entrance Tour\" ends with some pretty formations (stalactites & stalagmites). ",

There is a map of the park just a short way on the trail and a box with park brochures. Just a quick 2 minutes or so brings you out to the shoreline. The water here is so clear and it's quiet and peaceful. There are several hiking trails, but pay attention to the note on the brochure about this being a park with limited facilities. It's warm and there is not much shade. I chose not to do any of the other trails for this reason. I did head further along Hwy 19 to the actual park entrance and visitor center. There you can learn more about the park and start any of the walks. Bring water and a hat if you plan to do the trails. But for quiet reflection while standing in the cool water, I highly recommend walking in at the marina entrance.",

Traveling the Rim Rd, 18 miles out and then back, was one of the most scenic rides one could take. There are many scenic pull offs for viewing the Canyon and plenty of hiking trails for the more adventurous. Navajo Loop, Queens Garden, Sunrise Point and Bristlecone were hikes that we enjoyed and were listed as moderate hikes in the Park. Going in the off season we did not have to worry about crowds, and the weather was sunny and in the mid 40's, great for hiking.

It's advisable to take a small pack of water and muchies as a midway break; however, good luck finding a private tree or rock to go to the bathroom. It's difficult to find and may require you to head off the trail somewhat. Navaho is moderately stressful, elevating 500 feet up to 8,000 feet, so you may need to stop before reaching the top. November was perfect weather for this type of hike...can't imagine it in the summer. It's worth spending the extra $$ to get an annual pass to also use for Zion Kolob and Zion National Park",

We viewed a very informative film at the Visitor Center, and the souvenir shop had some quality items as well as the usual tourist souvenirs. We were able to go as far as the museum, an interesting place also. Quite a few observation outlooks made for quality photo ops. A little bit scary, since, after all, it is an active volcano, and could theoretically erupt at any time. Although the seismic measuring instruments would likely give plenty of warning, we were told that in a few instances, form was not followed by the volcano.

We used a lot of TA reviews and pointers to figure out if we were going to drive through the park and pull off at overlooks or if we were going to add in a hike. It is easiest to see the park by stopping at the park entrance/information center, getting a map, and then driving to the one of the further away over looks as most of them are on the left hand side of the road. We drove about 20-30 mins, turned around and then began stopping at the overlooks. We visited the park after lunch time so we missed the sunrise at Sunrise Point, however it was still beautiful. We parked at the Sunrise Point parking area and did the Navajo Trail from there to Sunset Point. The trail was steep at points and is about 3 miles. In the beginning of the trail it is a steady hike down and then you're on part of the canyon floor. On the way back up to Sunset Point, you are climbing back up to the rim and that was the hardest part of the hike. Leave yourself about 2 hours to do it and also let yourself rest in between difficult parts. Definitely a great hike and you get to see so many hoodoos and rock structures. There is a $25 fee for entrance to the park, but with the America The Beautiful Pass ($80 p/ year), you can enter for \"free.\" If you plan on visiting 3-4 parks on your trip, the ATB pass is a wonderful deal and you're contributing to our national parks.",

I was told at that point (at about noon) that the boat was cancelled due to mechanical difficulties. I was offered a chance to book for two days later, but we couldn't stay so I took the refund. The person I spoke to said he was going to start making calls, but I have no reason to believe that. I asked about other trips and there was a more expensive seaplane option. I looked into it, but it's practically a flyover and costs more than the boat (which already is expensive for a day trip). Those are the only options for a day in the Dry Tortugas. I have no idea how frequently these service problems occur, but it really was a pain in the neck. We did get our refund, but it might have been nice if the company had maybe sent us even an apology (a discount coupon in case we decided to chance it again would have been nicer and maybe the only thing that would persuade us to try again).",

It\u2019s $10 per car for 1 week entry \u2013 very reasonable. Speak to the rangers at the main visitors centre first. They\u2019ll give you ideas on what to do given your time frame. We found this really helpful. They also have guided tours you can go on, but we decided to explore the park on our own. My favourite trail was devastation. Even if you don\u2019t walk the whole trail it\u2019s worth walking a few minutes in to see part of it \u2013 the feeling was one that I\u2019d never had before. It was breathtaking and eerie all at the same time. Make sure you stay to see the glow from the lava after sunset\u2026 worth the wait! Take your water bottle and snacks/picnic with you \u2013 there isn\u2019t much in the park. Also, it does get cool and wet (weather changes in a heartbeat up there) so be prepared. We had a bite at the Lava Caf\u00e9 nearby \u2013 check my review list for thoughts on it.",

As you're driving up the mountain, you get a little peek of it up on the right side. If you have never been here before, its worth the visit. I walked around quite a bit and got some great exercise in the process. I enjoyed going reading all the material about how the mountain was carved, and all its history. There is a visitors center and a gift shop you can educate yourself and bring home a souvenir. I went on a weekday and apparently is the best time to go. It was not very crowded. There is no entrance fee but you do pay $11. to park. Be sure to drive around the side of the mountain where you will get a really cool side view of the monument. I have never seen a published shot before like that. See my photograph below.",

However, since I had read extensively about the battle, being there did help me better understand the geography of the battlefield. If you have time (at least half a day or more), I would advise skipping the CD (which, in itself, cost @ $20) or audio tape and simply getting out at each stop, reading the historical markers and walking the relevant parts of the battlefield.

We first stopped at the visitor\u2019s center to pick up maps and trail guides ($2 each and very useful in determining what you are looking at during your hike) and ask about current lava viewing conditions before heading off to the Kilauea Iki trailhead. It\u2019s good to go early while there\u2019s still plenty of parking. I believe we got there around 9am and the lot was about half full. The hike itself is amazing and it was easy to see why it\u2019s the most popular hike in the park. The rainforest makes you feel like you\u2019re in Jurassic Park and walking the still steaming crater floor was like walking on Mars or another barren planet. We were even able to see a couple of nene geese waddling by. The hike is 4 miles long and normally takes 2 to three hours but we finished in 4 hours due to taking a few \u201cdetours\u201d from the official path (not recommended as there's quite a bit of loose rock around). Since it\u2019s a long hike, it\u2019s a good idea to bring plenty of water and snacks, as well as sunscreen as there is very little shade on the crater floor. Near the end of the hike was the trail to the Thurston Lava Tube, basically a large, mostly underground, cavernous passage set amidst a tree fern forest. Because it rained the night before, it was an adventure trying to navigate around the water dripping from the ceiling and the numerous puddles on the floor. All in all, the walk took about 15 to 20 min. We spent more time exploring the rainforest outside the tube than the tube itself.",

We also visited Black Sand beach and saw a couple of turtles; didn't go to Green Sand beach, no time as it required walking 2 miles each way from when a car could reach. In the volcano park, you need to check with the rangers at the visitor center to see where you can go on that day, and at that moment. It's best to see the volcano after dark (6:30 pm). You need to get there early as the parking lot got full quickly. If you need to eat, there's a Military Camp close to where to watch the volcano. The camp's cafeteria and bar were open to public; the food was decent and price was reasonable there. How much of the volcano you can see depends on weather.

It is free to get into the Lincoln home, you just need a ticket from the welcome center, parking however is not, but the price of parking is reasonable. I did have the one to one tour with the ranger, probably because it was a week day and about 16 degrees outside. Honestly I didn't remember much from my first visit 40 some years ago and now. I remember more the outside of the house than the insides. I do love that they have two blocks around the house so you got a feel of what it \"looked\" like when the Lincolns lived there. The Welcome center does include a introductory movie on Lincoln which acts as a refresher to Lincoln's career prior to the Presidency. It was nice to re-visit this place.",

Our tour guide for Fort Jefferson, Chelsea, was very knowledgeable about the history of the Fort, going into compelling details about the life of Dr. Mudd, for example, but was very loath to entertain questions. Travelers need to be warned that the Fort has no railing on the second or third floors so young children must be carefully monitored to make sure they don't fall off the fort which is easy to do. Finally, if one does seek to snorkel, be sure to around the fort to the right of the port-sally to the back side and then head out in the water with the beach to your right to find coral and fish. Otherwise you may see nothing more than sand. Be aware that the snorkeling is not monitored and the surf can be strong.

The national park is very small consisting of 7 islands and we were allowed to go only in the Garden Key where the Fort Jefferson is located. The fort is massive but unfinished. NPS is trying to restore many breaking walls. We took a tour guided by the Yankee Freedom stuff and it was for an hour. After the fort tour we went for snorkeling in one of the beaches in the island.The water was really calm, beach is beautiful without any pollution. Since very few people manages to travel this far, place was like a tiny dream island. Actually there are ~5 NPS rangers stay permanently in the island. Snorkeling was great particularly near the harbor where ancient iron pillars are located. There war corals, star fishes and schools of fishes consisting of thousands of fish. I must have seen ~100 different kind of fish in the couple of hours I did snorkeling. DTNP is only reachable through Yankee Freedom II (can carry ~200 people) or by sea plane. Yankee freedom cost ~$165/ person and they will take care of the breakfast and lunch. There are nothing in the island except a tiny gift shop where you can buy souvenirs and stamp your National park passport. Overall the trip was from morning 7:30 to evening 5:30. On the way back we even saw dolphins and sea turtles swimming in the sea. We were back on time for the beautiful sunset from the Mallory square. ",

I'll say that we made it though the 2 hour guided walking tour because we are all fairly active but if you aren't I wouldn't recommend this tour as there are over 400 steps to retreat the cave. Now on to the fun stuff, we saw a couple of bats on the ceiling, there were \"fat man squeezes\" (our biggest guy is 260 so...), lots of history, opportunities to ask questions, plenty of photo opportunities, they even turn the lights out so you can see just how dark it is inside. Children must be well behaved and accompany an adult the entire tour or they will be escorted out we were told, we didn't have that problem! :) Make sure you dress warm as it's in the 50's year around. Tickets were $12 for adults, $6-8 for kids and the tour guides made it worth it. Would love to go back and try another tour next time but this one was great!",

Anyway, regardless of that, it is still worth going to (especially for $5/person) because you can still hike down quite a big and get a better view of the ruins. The views are pretty amazing. Crazy to think about how they lived back then. You would have to be tough as nails! There's also a very tiny museum at the visitor center worth the quick walk through. There are quite a few steep stairs on the paved trail down which I can see being difficult for some people but there are quite a few benches a long the way if you need to take breaks.

The guide did not introduce the different rooms we went to well. He said you will pass Crystal Lake before we entered the cave, but half of the people in the tour did not even realize they should look down to see it at when passing the spot (myself included). The guide often spent his time speaking to a few individuals in the front of the group and ignoring the rest of the group. At one point he said watch your step it is slippery. My 5 year old asked him where and his response was \"you'll find out\". That is okay to joke with adults like that, but not sure I thought it was inappropriate for my 5 year old daughter. The tour was short, part of the hour being the bus ride to and fro. Seeing deer along the ride was nice, actually sad to say one of the highlights of the tour. There were a few neat spots along the tour with interesting things to look at and the history of that part of the cave was good. In general though while this is worthwhile if you are just looking to kill a small amount of time, it isn't exactly an awe-inspiring experience and we left a little disappointed.",

Usually a guide is there to explain what happened there, why and when. The fort was typically staffed by 7 troops. This fort has a historical connection to Fort Caroline near Mayport, north of Jacksonville. Back in the day the French were anxious to get a piece of the new world and clashed with the Spanish. If a storm hadn't wrecked the French fleet, the history off the United States would probably have been much different. There is also a 1/2 mile nature trail.

You get your boarding pass from the park ranger at the centre, then board the ferry which goes every hour. The ferry is a little unpredictable due to the weather. When we arrived the signs said the ferry wasn't running that day since there had been a tornado warning in the morning. I wandered down to the dock to take some pictures of the fort since we couldn't go over. I then asked the ranger what the next day's forecast looked like. It was then that she told me the ferry was about to make it's first run of the day. ",

This is a great introduction to volcanism before a hike or boat ride to the actual flow. I haven't hiked up to the summit of Mauna Kea or hiked across the main crater, so I have something new to do when I return! Arrive early for the crowded hikes and dress in layers as it can be cool and windy, or hot and still.

Rent is $17, but they will refund $5 if you return it. A bit of a ripoff in retrospect. Nonetheless the kids had fun and learned a bit about the desert and how White Sands came to exist. There are many bathrooms on the grounds. The main bathrooms were small and well worn, and they were not overly clean, but functional.

The ride was 2 hrs. each way and we had 4:30 hrs. to snorkel, eat and tour. We swam along one whole side of the island and saw lots of beautiful fish. The history of the fort was very interesting and topical as Dr. Mudd who treated John Wilkes Boothe was imprisoned there. I believe the ferry would be too slow and not leave much time to enjoy the island. One of our group gets seaside very easily and cannot snorkel but the catamaran was so fast that even he was fine.

We visited on a Sunday, busy but not crowded, clear blue sky and light clouds reflecting in the lake. So what to do: only the visitor center and small store/deli are open?!? Take a hike! The rim road is snowed in but cross country skiers keep the track fresh. No skis, no problem. We did not even use snow shoes and hiked nearly 3 miles out on a pretty well packed snow path. Most of the time we were by ourselves. And if the quiet of nature is important, know that snowmobiles are not allowed at the south end of the park at all, so it is just the wind and the voices, yours and the others who take the chance to get out of the car. Several families with smaller children also hiked or skied that afternoon. Highly recommended! No fee in winter.",

Coming down out of the Mountains east of Alamogordo you can see the amazing stretch of white sands reaching out in all directions for miles. Comprising 275 square miles this amazing anomaly is interesting and a fun stop for persons of any age. The white sand is created from gypsum in the surrounding mountains as it is broken up by nature and then washed down into the valley by rains. Blown by the winds the pieces of gypsum are eventually ground by the wind and water into the finest sand-like particles and then formed into 60 foot high dunes again by the prevailing winds. A national park staff operate a small visitor center and are extremely helpful in educating visitors about the dunes and providing maps and guidance for venturing. A 15 minute narrated film show the high lights of the dunes, along with the plants and animals that make their home in the dunes. Day camping on the dunes is permitted as is \"sand boarding\" down from the tops of the dunes on plastic round snow discs. The sliding is exciting and fun for \"kids\" of all ages. The cost to enter the 16 mile round trip driving loop into the dunes is only $3 a person and you won't even have to leave the comfort of your vehicle to enjoy this incredible national treasure, unlike any other in the world!",

In addition to viewing the place where Grant met Lee to accept his surrender we also got a most excellent feel for what a small community clustered around a court house would have been like. The park ranger was very informative, the film at the visitor's center was very comprehensive. Give yourself at least 3 hours to investigate the entire site well. One caution....there are two \"courthouses\" in Appomatox - be sure you are headed to the National Park Site and not the courthouse where one would pay a parking fine. Also..be aware that the hotels in Appomatox are substandard (at best) so staying in nearby Lynchburg or at a local B&B might be a good idea. I stayed at the Super 8 - the people were nice and the place is clean but the mattress was a dismal lump, the sheets were gray and worn thin and the bedspread was straight from the 1980's.",

We opted for the guided tour, which I recommend, our tour guide was informative and humorous. This lasted about an hour. There was a deli style lunch available back on the boat, so after we wandered around the prison a little more we went and ate lunch. From here we took our cooler and blankets and spread out on the beach. The day was quite warm, but the water was wonderful. Part of group opted to snorkel, while the rest of us sat about waist deep in the water and chatted the afternoon away. We walked around the prison on this brick path that was in the water and could watch other people snorkel and could see fish. they allow you to bring your own coolers full of refreshments. They also have a cash bar on the return trip. It is a little pricey, but since we are locals, go a good discount. It is very worth the price to go, but I couldn't imagine being out there if our boat had been full (as it was maybe at 1/3 capacity). Fun day, great crew (tip them-they appreciate it!!)",

We also visited the Grand Canyon on the trip, but honestly, we enjoyed Bryce much more. The Grand Canyon was, of course, spectacular, but the crowds of people, the fighting for parking and most of all the agree of watching people do silly things so close to the edges (I can see why people have unfortunately fallen there) really took much away from our enjoyment.

Because park admission for one car for an entire week is only $10 and we went back 3 times over 2 days and it was easy to drive back and forth from where we were saying. The first afternoon we arrived, it was rainy and foggy. We stopped at the visitor center which was busy and crowded, so we quickly left and went to the Jagger museum which is right at the edge of the crater. The museum is small but interesting. Unfortunately for us, the crater was socked in with clouds and we couldn't see a thing. So we drove down to the lava tube which is on the other side of the park. The tube is well-lit, easy to walk through and pretty impressive to see. We then continued to follow the park roads down toward the ocean and down to lower altitude where there was far better visibility and we could view the old lava fields all the way down to the ocean. It was spectacular. ",

The tour was very well done and included recordings made by the President and the First Lady. The family cemetery and gravesites of the Pres. and Mrs. Johnson seemed like a quiet country cemetery that could be found anywhere was quite a contrast to the sprawling \"Texas White House\" with the presidential jet and luxury cars just down the road! The house has been restored to the way it was during Johnson's presidency and a $3 ticket gets a quick tour with basic information of the main floor. There is not much time to really look at things, but the tour guides answer questions. Groups are moved through the house quickly, but you can take as much time as you want wandering around the property, seeing the oak tree under which Johnson held meetings (one quarter of his presidency was spent here so the run way was well used by those meeting with him here rather than in Washington), the river bank where barbecues with top entertainment for up to 1500 people were held, the garages with glass sides providing easy viewing of Johnson cars etc. Very interesting were the cement slabs on which guests to the ranch \"wrote\" their names. It was fun finding names of other presidents, politicans, entertainers, astronauts etc. Our only downer was leaving the park at closing time when we stopped almost at the gate, hoping to take a quick final picture from the car. A car with a guide pulled up beside us and told us to leave immediately as she was locking the gate and we would have to call 911 to get out! That took more time than it would have for us to take the picture - and left us feeling a little less enthused about the experience. There are also very good exhibits etc. at the visitors' center.",

Temperatures fluctuated 50 degrees between day and night. (Frost on tent in the morning; only the slightest of breeze just before dawn.) Cost about $9 total at gate for admission and camping permit. Checked in at visitor's center for assignment. Ranger very friendly and helpful. Nice small exhibits. Children wished bathrooms were more clean; they didn't like graffiti. Very little in way of sundries at gift shop. We brought one plastic disc for dunes. They sell them there but at a premium price. They also sell wax, which might have been a good purchase. Trailhead is about 8 miles from visitor's center, with large lot and vault toilet. As mentioned, the \"trail\" is from post to post. Easier on top of dunes; climbing can be soft and tough with weight on your back. We planned only for one overnight: brought lots of warm clothes, bags & blankets, food, stove, tent, lots of water, etc. Even for our short time in winter, I can imagine you could get burned easily. Children loved playing and a little exploring. This is Leave No Trace (pack in/pack out) camping. Actually got a phone signal from top of dunes near our camp site. Quickly warmed in morning; fun trek out; you can see road and lot from distance; saw other early morning hikers. Afterward we visited the Space Museum in Alamogordo, which we liked.",

Your journey into the \"twilight zone\" as they referred to it was filled with history and humor. You could tell our guide really enjoyed his job and his enthusiasm was contangious. We did the historic tour which took us over 300 feet below the surface. I wouldn't recommend this tour if you have a bad back, neck or knees. There were close to 500 stairs and lots of crouching. The ground you walked on was often rocky and muddy. Wear a comforable pair of gymshoes that you don't mind if they get dirty. You will come out a little dusty! Also, make sure to wear long pants and a jacket or a heavy fleece as the temperatures below drop to a cool 50 degrees. Overall, a great experience for people of all ages! The property also has their own postal office and grocery store. Edmonson County is a dry county, but Mammoth Cave is government owned so they are exempt. Be sure to stock up on liquor at the grocery store. Their prices were cheaper than most liquor stores in Bowling Green!",

The drive there from ABQ is about 2 1/2 hours (via US 550 turning onto County Road 7900 -- we inquired about the road from Crownpoint but were advised not to use this road as it's very rough, even for 4x4 trucks). The last 14 miles are over unpaved wash-board road. We have a large 4x4 truck and so this was no problem for our truck. We did see and pass several passenger cars (Camry, Civic, etc.) and they can make the trip in with no problem (other than having to go about 5mph for these last 14 miles). Once in the road around the park is well paved. There are several outstanding examples of ruins all built between 850 and 1250 AD. You can walk around everything you see but of course not within the ruins structures (same almost everywhere in the southwest). You must stop into the park headquarter building to pay your entrance fee and when you do you'll receive a map to the area. The map is very helpful for pointing out what there is to see. We were there a total of about five hours and filled the time completely. On a return trip we plan on taking the hike from the parking area at the top of the loop road (the loop road is four miles long) to the mesa overlooking Pueblo Bonita so we can get the overview of these unique ruins.

However they do stop for breaks regularly including a lunch break where you can purchase a sandwich, soup, cookie and drink for $8.50. Personally I'd recommend packing a light lunch and taking with you. A small daypack is easy to manage as you walk through the cave. And I'd take a small flashlight too.

We left the park around 8 p.m. and took hwy 11 back to Kona, taking 2 hrs 15 mins. On arriving we went for a short walk with a Ranger which was very informative. Crater Rim drive was closed at the Jagger Museum so after spending some time in the museum and viewing area, we drove back, stopped at the Thurston Lava tube then onto Chain of Craters Road. Park signage could be better as a few times we stopped at areas that didn't seem to be much but turned out to be really worthwhile.... 1969-1974 Mauna Ulu lava flows for one.... short walk from parking lot. Went as far as we could go on Chain of Craters road...to the 2003 lava flows and walked on some of the youngest land on earth.... where the lava flowed across the road. In the distance on the shoreline, we could just about see some steam where the lava is presently entering the ocean. Went back to the Jagger Museum stopping at the Military Camp for Starbucks (Yes!) coffee.... they also serve good food at the camp. The Jagger Museum car park filled up very quickly around 6p.m. and people had to park in the overflow parking lot a short walk away, but by about 7.30 p.m. it was half empty.... perhaps because the temperatures had dropped considerably and it was cold... bring a jacket. Awesome to see the glowing flume cloud at night. So much to see for only $10 per vehicle! My only regret is we didn't get time to hike the Kilauea Iki trail which I really wanted to do.... will have to go again!!! If we were to go again, I would make this trail a priority and maybe stop off at the military camp for dinner before heading up to the Jagger Museum (around 8p.m.) for nighttime viewing of Kilauea. Apart from driving through pouring rain in Hilo area, the weather in the park was sunny and warm.... shorts and t-shirt.... although around about 5p.m. a fleece and/or jacket plus gloves was needed.",

The sculptures themselves are very simple. The artist did not use of many traces to make his point. Reminds me of Egyptian sculpture actually. Their eyes impressed me the most.

There are really trashy looking houses and the road is littered with trash and empty beer and soda bottles. This hwy is nothing to write home about and makes it hard to beleive anything of interest could possibly lie ahead. But it does! The road is paved all the way albeit a little rough and any vehicle can make the drive. Once you arrive the canyon and ruins are visible. It is one beautiful canyon and quite different from the all so many red rock canyons of the area. It consists of large sandstone (I think) rocks but they are whiteish. Pinon pine and junipers cover the nearby terrain as well as the valley floor. The ruins look really unstable since many are on rock bed which is sliding down the hill. They are still amazing structures to look at. The National Park service has wonderful facilities and drinking water. They have a really nice network of paths which allow you to get up close to the ruins without disturbing them while keeping you safe and giving you the best views of the canyon. Warning. Stay on the trails and leave everything you come across alone. They have people disguised as tourist watching you and will gladly give you a $275 fine. ",

There is a guide up there to explain the dwellings. There are places a bit down below the site on trails (one is called \"Lower Scorpion Campground\") where it is ok to walk dogs. There are some ancient dwellings and petroglyphs there also. It was cool, sunny, and dry and I (and the corgi dog who was having a great time on the trail) did not want to leave the place.

We did it in a day trip out of Albuquerque, so we left at 6 a.m. and were there before 10 a.m. It is a beautiful drive, and if you get going early, you can easily spend 6 hours at the park exploring the sites and be back in Albuquerque by sunset. It was a wonderful day of sight seeing, and the ruins are truly stunning. There are examples of different brick patterns, and the circular buildings are amazing. There are picnic tables nearby, where you can enjoy a lunch (bring your own food and beverages), and there are bathroom facilities. The interior park is paved, but there is a 10 to 15 mile stretch of unpaved road you have to drive, so an SUV, or higher off the ground vehicle, is the preferred means of transport. You can maneuver it in a car, but you will have to drive very slow to dodge all the ruts.....and you can't dodge them completely. It does feel like you are driving on a washboard. But do not let that stop you from going, as that part of the trip is very short compared to the payoff when you see the sites. There are many trails, and if you stay longer, you can hike to the top and get a cliff view of the ruins. We saw lots of lizards and birds. It is very remote, so do not plan on cell phone reception. I also recommend taking pleny of sunscreen, as even when it is cool, the sun is closer and burning down. We went in Spring, and I can't image going at the height of the summer as I bet the temperatures get extremely hot. The winds can also be strong, so if you can, it is best to go on a nice day, especially since the unpaved road section can be problematic with rain, etc. Chaco Canyon is totally worth the trek, and it is one of the few places in the USA where you can find important ruins from over 1000 years ago.

There are a lot of things to do here, and I'd budget at least 2 days to do everything, particularly if you want to see the volcano at night. We'd strongly recommend planning for an overnight in Hilo, which will give you the time to see all that the park has to offer. At a minimum, plan on hitting the visitors center, the Jaggger Museum, Thurston Lava Tube, Devastation Trail. Also highly recommend the Chain of Craters road and the hike out to the Petroglyphs. Lots of chances for hiking in a variety of different climates. Bring snacks and drinks, you'll need them. Also, we wouldn't recommend flip flops or flimsy shoes. You are better off with something a little sturdier. If you are planning on doing Haleakala and Pu'uhonua o Honaunau consider purchasing a tri park pass.",

So you buy the sleds for 17 bucks I believe, although I think the used ones cost $10. You return them and receive $3 bucks back. We just bought ours from someone else for $5 and still saved $2. It's incredibly hot during the day to go walking or hiking or sledding - it can drain you. Consistent with desert climates, it does get chilly at night so dress in layers if you go. I recommend visiting either early morning and/or right before, during and after sunset. We particularly enjoyed the sunset views, walking deeper into the sand dunes to find better and bigger ones to sled down. Feel free to keep driving as far into the park as you can to find the untouched, cleaner dunes (less plants). The only comparable place that I've seen to White Sands are the Sossuvlei Dunes in Namibia, Southern Africa (but they are golden sands and not white). The white sand really does look like an Arctic landscape. Be sure to wear bright colors for an awesome photo-op. We took a picture of my friend jumping up in a red outfit and caught her midair- it came out phenomenal in the sea of white. You'll see some professional photo shoots also. I know they have sunset strolls, we missed arriving for that on time but I bet you learn a lot with the ranger. We just enjoyed strolling about on our own and trying to climb the dunes after sledding down. It's a workout! We also saw a cool beetle or two which was fun..it's an ethereal and unforgettable landscape. You feel like you're on another planet. Oh and they had the full moon bike ride that night too which we could not sign up for..if you're in town for that next time, you should definitely do it.",

We were offered a free guide (in fact the whole darn experience was free...no entrance fee, which we would have gladly paid). There is a 2 mile walking loop that ascends the mesa after an interesting walk along the base. The lower section is paved and easy. The ascent to the top is not at all difficult but does go UP. We took our time and were rewarded with a remarkable view as well as what was, to us, crazy eery topography as we walked along the top. There is a bench under some trees not far from where we crested the mesa that would be a good place to stop, eat a light lunch or snack (self-provided of course), relax and enjoy the serenity of the place.

The entrance fee is $25 for 7 days. You can drive all the way to the end point - 18 miles ... with scenic points along the way to look down into the 'canyon'. THEN you can see what everyone's talking about. Each viewpoint is different and the colours and shapes are awesome. Note: the parking lots at each viewpoint can accommodate both cars and RV's but they can fill up quickly as some of them are the starting points for hikes. The park has an excellent shuttle bus service that picks up and drops off at many different points along the way and is an great alternative to driving and it's free! Camping in the park is limited and fills up VERY quickly in the summer - we were there in May and one campground was full although the other one was only about 1/2 full. Prices are $15 for an RV with 2 people per night. If you're looking at them on-line it's confusing as the on-line maps show 'North' Campground and 'South' Campground but when you get there it's North and SUNRISE campground. Not South. The North one is the first you come to and of course that fills up first - also it has a shower and general store inside the campground. The Sunrise is actually a little nicer tho I think. Both campgrounds have NO hookups at all so be warned. There are private campgrounds near with full hookups although they're pricey. There is a lodge also which looks pretty cool. It was built in the 1920's and just looks like it's out of a movie! I don't know the prices for the lodge. (There's also a very cool gift shop inside!)",

If a one day trip, I recommend starting early heading to Chaco on U.S. 550 from Farmington or Bernalillo. That way you can get to CR 7900 turn off (Mile marker 112.5) by first light and brave the sometimes rough dirt road. Actually the first 8 miles (5.1 miles on 7900 and 3 miles on 7950) are paved. The last 5 miles before the park entrance are the slowest. Once in the Park, all roads are paved (except in the campground). Stop by the Visitor Center to pay the day fee, and get a brochure. Head first to Pueblo del Arroyo parking lot and take the Pueblo Alto trail (trailhead just behind Kin Kletso site) and proceed to the Pueblo Bonito overlook (about 0.7 miles) to get a panorama view of the complex. Backtrack to the parking lot and take one of the Pueblo Bonito tours given by informed Rangers at 10am, 2pm, or 4pm. Tours begin at the Pueblo Bonito/Chetro Keti parking lot.

After a brief stop at the visitor\u2019s center I was directed to the Arnold House where I was met by a Ranger who escorted our group on a very informative tour of the Lincoln Home. The guided tour of the home took about 45-minutes and our guide was quite knowledgeable and more than willing to answer the questions posed by the members of our group. I was very pleased to find out that photos inside of the Home are not only permitted but encouraged. Following the guided tour we were free to visit the other home and sites around the historic area.

I suggest parking in the lower level of the garage with the windows mostly open to keep your pet cool (leave fresh water for him too). My husband and I walked the trails around the monument and even a few trails outside of the official monument area where we saw mountain goats in the distance. At night, we returned for a special salute to veterans accompanied by video and the lighting of the monument at night. The park ranger asked all the veterans to come forward and selected 6 (my hubby included!) to retire Old Glory for the evening. It was an exciting day to be part of such iconic America.",

I'd recommend booking your tour online ahead of your visit if you have your heart set on a certain tour and time (the tours sell out fast). My only complaint about the tour is that the other tour group members were a bit inconsiderate (which I suppose happens in a group of 120 people). Even though our tour guide reminded people many times to be careful with their camera flashes, people still were flashing away whenever they wanted, which meant we were often blinded! This tour has some slippery, uneven footing, tight spaces and many stairs. I wouldn't recommend it if you are not in decent physical condition--there are other easier tours to take instead. ",

There is a walk around the grounds where you can get several different vantage points along the route. It is actually quite breathtaking to see in person. I didn't do the audio tour as I didn't realize that was an option when I was there. My only criticism is that there is not a film to view during the day. You have to go back at night to see the film at the lighting ceremony. I went to the lighting ceremony. When I got there, fog was completely covering the monument. For about an hour, it lifted right around the faces. A few minutes before the ceremony was to start, the fog covered it again. The ceremony began with a 20-minute film. Just as the National Anthem began, the fog lifted and the faces were lit up. It was spectacular and I highly recommend it, even if it is a foggy night! You never know what will happen.",

The basics are provided in the museum which should take about 30 minutes to go through and while not cutting edge was certainly acceptable. There are numerous stops along the way including replica barracks, a memorial arch, and the memorial chapel (which I did not do). The stop at Washington's residence and command center really helped to piece the entire site together for me. The NPS Guides were particularly helpful and the more experienced guides were very good at rooting out the knowledge level of the visitor and helping them out. Free of charge to go through the site on your own, a small charge to go into the Washington Memorial Chapel, and of course a higher charge should you choose to do one of the guided tours.

Using our National Parks Pass (costs $80 bucks and allows everyone in your party free entrance into any National Park), we were able to get on the Park's trolley which took us over to the visitor center in downtown Quincy. There, they have a short video which covers some of John Adams' life and a gift shop. The tour has an itinerary and runs according to a strict schedule. From the visitors center, the trolley takes you to the birthplaces (homes) of both John Adams and John Quincy Adams. The park rangers take you inside each residence and give you a quick back story on their lives in those homes. Next, they take you by trolley to the \"Old House\" where four generations of Adams eventually lived. The grounds here are beautiful and the National Park Service clearly puts in a lot of time and effort to maintain the land.

We arrived at the island a little over 2 hours from the time we left and participated in the 45 minute tour of Fort Jefferson. Lots of great history and the tour guide knew his stuff! He allowed plenty of time for questions. Worthwhile to go and learn about the fort and the island. We then returned to the boat for lunch and to get snorkel equipment. We spent the next few hours snorkeling after some brief instructions by the staff. What an experience!! This was the first time our kids have gone snorkeling and they were blown away!!

Water was available all day for no extra charge. Words cannot describe the environment that awaits you, so I wont even bother....just go. This is a once in a lifetime trip for most and the cost is justified. I had to laugh at some of the negative reviews...I don't know where these people thought they were going. A few warnings...if you can't part with your smartphone for a few hours DONT GO...if you expect shopping DONT GO...if you think you are going to a tropical resort DONT GO...if you don't want a long boat ride DONT GO. If you want to experience one of the most pristine areas left in the United States then this trip should be added to your \"bucket list\"! The weatherman was calling for torrential rains all day long on the day of our trip (the flooded streets were eveidence upon our return) but the crew stated that the weather on the Turtugas,70 miles out into the ocean, would be partly cloudy and beautiful, as it usually is.

In fact, I would not recommend the trail up the \"mountain\" for small children or anyone with mobility issues, because you have to scramble over rocks. The view from the top was awesome, and there were several signs that told us what petroglyphs we were looking at, as well as more information about the volcanic rock. It gets pretty hot out there, and there's not much in the way of shelter. We did find some graffiti written on a rock; however, the ranger had already told us what was real art and what was not. All you have to do is ask! Our kids did the Junior Ranger program, which was easier than in other parks, and you get a badge, patch, and certificate, which is also more than some other parks.

We then drove to Thurston Lava Tube and walked through the forest and then through the tube. Beautiful hike, short, easy to do. Then back to the visitors center to view the volcano. That was a little disappointing, it was drizzling rain, misty, just not much to see.

I don't think my brother shard my excitement but by the time we had left he did say he had enjoyed the visit. We arrived around 5pm one September evening, had a walk to the Grand View Terrace, where I was impressed by the size of the amphitheatre. We then took the walk around the base of the monument which gave some good different perspectives of the 4 famous faces. Even though there's no admission fee for the monument itself, you do have to pay a fee to park, which I think was $15. When you think of the work that went into creating the monument itself, never mind the parking structure, I think $15 is a bargain. I'd happily go again in the future too.",

The dirt road was very wash board and had thick sand in many places. The 19 miles of dirt road took about 90 minutes in my 4x4 truck. Once there, the park was awesome. We saw six of the main ruins in 6 hours and they were all close (1/2 mile or less) from the parking lots. The six main ruins are Una Vida (ruins and petroglyphs), Hungo Pavi (ruins), Cheltro Keti (has the largest Kiva I have ever seen, ruins and petroglyphs), Pueblo Bonito (very large ruins), Pueblo del Arroyo (ruins) and Casa Rinconada (ruins).

There's great diversity in the different sections of the canyon. And great beauty. And there are hikes that are more demanding, or less demanding. The ranger station was bustling but it's well organized, with excellent maps and info and staff on hand to give advice about which hike might be best for you, etc. The entrance fee is about $25 if you're just going to Bryce, but the best deal is to buy a seasonal or annual pass that works for all of the state or national parks. But it's worth $25 or more, alone, and in spite of there being a lot of visitors it did not feel crowded. Also, just outside the park, we encountered a little rodeo late in the afternoon which was a charming addition to the day. I think those happen twice a week in the summer. It is a magical place, more special than photos can show.",

Outside you can walk along paths and see actual bones protruding from the rocks. And, yes, it is ok to touch them. The geology of the area is fascination and gives you a real feel for how the earth changes and moves. Also around this amazing place are petroglyphs and an old western cabin owned by Josie Bassett. While at the cabin my husband and I had separate and slightly unnerving experiences, which lead me to believe it is haunted. If you read up on Josie, you will see that she lead quite an interesting and eventful life. So if you like dinos, fossils and geology don't pass it by.",

It is located near French Creek State Park near Elverson PA. Although I'm from Oregon and we think we have the great scenery thing covered, there is nothing more beautiful than the woods and hills of Pennsylvania! This historic community and furnace is settled in a lush valley, with the original buildings and a working furnace. There are re-enactors who operated the furnace, made a mold and actually poured hot metal to make a casting. You can see an original water wheel, the blacksmith shop, and the original \"big house\" that is open for touring. There is lots of open space, perfect for a stroll or a simple hike. Note: there are some steep steps or, alternately, sloping but gravel paths. Strollers and wheelchairs seem possible but check in advance on this point.

There is an entrance gate, $25 a car, $12 on foot, motorcycle, etc., and for me $0.00 because I'm 62+ and bought a Lifetime Pass for $10. The visitor's center is about 100 feet from the entrance. Stop at the visitor's center.There is a free museum which is very informative. A 22 minute video, wildlife taxidermy, geology and more. Free WiFi, publications, backcountry permits, lost and found, shuttle service and most importantly Ranger advise. Tell them how long you plan to stay and they will develop an itinerary for you. This way you will get the most out of your stay.Most people do Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration and Bryce point, That is where the amphitheatre can be viewed (Hoodoos). I think World of Warcraft (thousand Needles) was designed after the Hoodoos.As you travel further from the visitor's center (6,900')the elevation rises. At Rainbow point, the farthest point, it is 9115 feet. The oxygen level is 70 percent of oxygen at sea level. Figure in the heat and sometimes steep climbs on hikes if you plan on some of the hiking trails. You might want a guided tour on horseback into the canyon.After the amphitheatre view points are mostly about long distance views of up to 100 miles. Shuttles are free but only run to Rainbow Point twice a day. The other points every every 15 minutes. There are Ranger lead Geology talks, Rim Walk, Canyon Hikes, Astronomy lectures and telescope use and Full Moon Hikes which you need to sign up early for.Ruby's Inn located before the entrance has a Post Office, ATM and Internet. Speed limits in the park run 15-45 MPH. Yes, people are stopped and fined. If you are going to Capitol Reef after Bryce Canyon take Scenic Byway 12. it might be the best in Utah and maybe the country.",

There is a visitor's center which is open 8-4:30 and has geology, natural science abd cultural displays. A short orientation video is also given. As with all National Parks, Rangers will assist you in planning an itinerary for the duration of your stay. The highlights of Capitol Reef are the Fremont petroglyphs, the Mormon Homestead, the school house, blacksmith shop, Ripple Rock Nature Center. the Fruita (orchard) and the 16 mile Scenic Drive and backcountry. There are two dirt roads off the Scenic Drive which take you to Cathedral Valley where you walk between vertical cliffs. The Scenic Drive ends in a loop where you turn-around and head back to the visitor's center. The Scenic Drive costs $15 dollars but is free with a Senior Lifetime Pass or other National Park Pass. The Fruita grows apple, peach, cherry, pear, and apricots. Pies and other baked goods are available during the harvest season. Eat what you like for free. If you want to pick and take home there is a minimal fee. They have historic and heirloom varieties. Off of Scenic Highway 24 westbound and about a 1/2 mile from the visitor's center you will find the old school house and Fremont (700 AD-1250 AD) petroglyphs.

The Visitor Center provides a good start to the tour with a good orientation film. However, this can actually be viewed either before or after the neighborhood tour. The tour requires tickets and the number of participants is limited for each time slot. Several Rangers take you through each stage of the Lincoln Home explaining each room and the significance it played in the Lincoln family life. The rest of the restored neighborhood extended one block in each direction. I recommend using the cell phone tour to explain each of the homes and lots that were in the Lincoln's neighborhood. There are two other neighborhood homes that are open allowing visitors to walk through. It is incredible that there is no fee for this tour (as per Robert Todd Lincoln's condition for turning the house over to the government).

The tour takes about 1.5 hours and there is a charge. We were very lucky to have re-enactors in the encampment area, so heard about life in the camp \"first hand\" from the enlisted men and a surgeon. You can imagine what life was like in the small cabins inhabited by the ranks and officers as you stand in them. As one other reviewer noted, the quarters of George Washington are quite impressive and the rooms are decorated in a very believable manner. If you are not into history and don't want to ride a bus, but would like to take a hike or a walk, there are maps at the visitor's center with trails and approximate length of most of them. There is no fee to visit the park itself. You can also visit each site/monument in the park on your own either walking or driving as the map of the park is quite detailed.

We entered from the north and took the shuttle bus from the visitor's center all the way to the last stop at Rainbow Point. We walked the short paths to the observation points. Then we took the bus north stopping Natural Bridge and then Inspiration Point. We walked a short distance to Inspiration Point overview (well worth it) and then walked the mostly downhill Rim hike from Inspiration Point to Sunset Point passing Bryce Amphitheater with an early audience (keep an eye out for the hoodoos which look like an audience) and Thor's Hammer. Then we hopped back on the shuttle to take it to Sunrise Point and access to the Queen's Garden trail. The Queen's Garden walk descends 320 feet below the rim with rest benches near the formation called Queen Victoria. On the way down you will pass the Boat Mesa, the sinking ship, Queen Victoria and her castle (these are easily recognizable with just a little imagination). I suggest you just note where they are on the way down because when you turn around to come back up, you will realize the trail was much steeper than you thought. That's why I suggest you take pictures on the way up. This will give you an excuse to stop frequently and catch your breath and you won't look like a wimp. This trail is really the best for seeing the most interesting hoodoos close up.",

I was a little worried about 2 babies that women strapped to them when we walked in. Within the first few steps, the babies started screaming and they had to turn around and walk back out.

There is a parking garage behind the Center, though it's kind of confusing as a good deal of the spaces are marked \"reserved\" for local business employees. Head up to the third level for visitor parking. And take your garage ticket to the Visitor Center with you - they will stamp it so your parking will be free (otherwise, it will cost you $4-5 to park for the lengh of a tour.) The tour costs only $5 and starts at the Visitor's Center with a movie (about 15 minutes). A trolley picks you up from there and drives your group to the first two Adams homes, and then to another site where the third home is located. The homes are very interesting to see, and the tour guides - as the National Park Service rangers usually are - are wonderful and very knowledgeable. Allow about 2 hours for the tour, plus extra waiting time for the next tour to start (there is a gift shop in the Center to keep you busy). I believe the tours run every hour. The only negative thing I can say is that we weren't encouraged to walk around the gardens at Peacefield (the third home), though I believe you are allowed to if you want to. If you are looking for a meal or snack before or after your visit, I recommend Gunter Tootie's across the street from the Visitor's Center for a yummy sandwich, salad, or pastry.",

Take some time and view all the different areas in the park to see the figures. The lighting ceremony for me was a must. We went two nights and the better place to see is the seats above the auditorium by the elevators, just not the first row. The best place to hear is on the auditorium floor. We got there by 8 to get to our seats, the ceremony started at 9. We looked around a little while my husband saved us seats. The highlight of the lighting ceremony is the retiring of the flag with the veterans or current people serving in the armed forces. The lighting ceremony was very informative and patriotic. Make sure you view the movie, see the sculptors studio, and walk the presidential trail. If you have kids the must do is the Jr Ranger program, my 10 year old loved it. My fourteen year old also did it. You have to get the book from any ranger anywhere in the park, and when you complete it you take it back to any ranger. The ranger will ask them a few questions and then they take an oath of a ranger and get a badge to wear. A great program and it focuses the kids on learning something other than just looking and not learning! The park spends a lot of time on the making and history of Mount Rushmore, which is all centered around Borglum. As you make your way around the park and the exhibits you really start to feel the passion of Borglum and what he wanted to do. The park also has a great gift shop, one of the biggest and best in the area we saw. The ice cream shop was ice cream, nothing special. The food was good and not overly priced.

We noticed that some of the tours were sold out. If your schedule is tight or you are visiting on a summer or holiday weekend, then I recommend purchasing the tickets online before you arrive to the park.

In a family graveyard with nice grave stones but nothing over the top. The main house is $3 per person to enter but worth the effort and price. They have kept it as it was when they lived there. There are many of their personal items still in the home. Extremely interesting to look in their closets. Lady Bird sure did love color. The landing strip, the cars, etc are all interesting to see. I can only imagine what the world thought of Johnson City. Extremely glad we made the stop. Hope to return in the near future and spend more time on some of the other buildings on the property. We did the loop drive and spent our time at the main house. We also stopped at the graveyard. Nice that they let you do the loop in your own vehicle vs the bus I remember as a child.",

I noticed quite a few people dozing...maybe they had taken motion sickness meds, but the boat is very large and I think most people won't be bothered much by sea-sickness. The water is beautiful and Garden Key, where you will land, offers snorkeling and the historical Fort Jefferson.

The line was short at this time but we noticed throughout the day, it was very long. It's definitely a must see thought! The tour of Independence Hall is well organized but a bit rushed. It was awe-inspiring to be in the same room that our founding fathers had debated and adopted the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. I must say that our guide, Ranger Eric Knight was the BEST guide that I have ever experienced. He truly made you think and appreciate the significance of what we were experiencing.

The museum is fun for the kids, offering a seizmeter where you jump as hard as you can and measure the size of the 'earthquake' that you created. It is also educational, with the history of the park and previous eruptions covered in spectacular photographs and written accounts, you can also fee the lava rocks on display. The highlight of the visit is to stay till after sunset and witness the red glow coming from the active volcano. You need to be prepared to fight for space to see the active volcano as everyone wants a turn and take a jacket because it gets chilly after dark.

My daughter's admission was free & I think I had to pay twelve dollars for mine, which is well worth it. Took a short bus ride to the cave, then headed underground. To start, you'll have to go down approximately 300 steps or so, and they're all different sizes, heights, and shapes, some where you need to weave around portions of rock. I'm not complaining I had fun, and surprisingly, so did my daughter. I just wanted to give out this information to help anyone considering this adventure-- definitely not handicap accessible, or for anyone with bad knees (or any other major health concern). My only real complaint, which I know is no one's fault & there can't be anything done about this, is that there were way too many giant legged cave crickets crawling inches away from my face, clothes, and hair, on the low ceilings and cramped walls. Those things terrify me, so I shrieked an awful lot more than I'd care to admit. Otherwise, a fun outing! Thank you, Mammoth Cave!",

        "text": "If you are planning a visit to Hawaii, and are interested in some adventure beyond beaches and snorkeling, and want to see a wonder, then Hawaii volcanoes national park is a MUST. It can be seen in half a day, one day or several days depending on how much time you have. We did two half days as we did not have enough time to do a hike the first time we went. It is closer from Hilo than from Kona, so would suggest spending a day in Hilo and going to the park from there. If you want to do both sides, Kona as well as Hilo, you could fly into one airport and leave from the other. You can finish up Volcanoes national park while in Hilo and then proceed to Kona visa Mauna Kea/Mauna Loa so that you get to cover that as well. The best way to see the sights at the national park is to make your first stop at the visitor center - depending on the amount of time you have, they will explain in detail what you can see, when, and how to get there. the Kilauea crater should be seen both in day light and in the evening to really see the effect - especially if you are going at a time when lava flow is not great, this can give the desired effect of seeing a volcano. The Thurston lava tube is a short walk, but beautiful as it takes you through lush green rain forests and imagine walking through the tube, where once lava used to flow! The other place worth visiting is where the lava flow has blocked off the road, this was the impact of a more recent lava flow in 2002 or 2003. The road is buried underneath lava rocks and you can walk and hop over black lava rocks, alongside the beautiful blue ocean; the arch along the ocean formed by lava is also here. If you have 2 to 3 hours, a must do hike is the Kilauea Iki, it is not too difficult, there is some amount of up hill and downhill, but if you are a moderate hiker you can do it. The best thing about the hike is that it takes you through a volcanic crater, this volcano last erupted in 1959, there are still steam vents around and you can smell sulphur and how cool is it to walk across a volcanic crater! There is supposed to be another hike along the crater of the active volcano which is about 11 miles or so, since we did not have more than 2 to 3 hours we did not do that one. If you want to see the lava flowing into the ocean, that happens near a private property, so there is no access from the national park, you have to take one of those expensive private hiking tours. We also did the helicopter tour, I would say it was average as the volcanic activity was not very high, the tour on top of the volcanic region was definitely very good, but we took one that goes over water falls as well, I would rather skip that and pay less. The chopper ride seemed quite over priced for what you actually get to see, so if you really want to do it, take the minimum one - the one that goes just over the volcanic crater. There is also a boat ride that takes you close to the lava flow into ocean, they have a facebook page wherer they post pictures on a daily basis so that you know what to expect, but the boat ride itself is supposed to be very choppy. I have severe motion sickness, so we dint want to venture and regret, but if you can manage choppy boat ride (the waves literally throw the boat up and down), you will get totally drenched (so you can imagine how rocky the ride must be), and take medication before the ride, may be you can try it, the view is supposed to be out of the world.",

It combines a 5 hour plus boat excursion, a top-notch guided tour of historic Fort Jefferson, & uncrowded, pristine beaches with fine snorkeling. The generous buffet breakfast & lunch served were very basic fare that was fresh & tasty with plenty of healthy choices. Really fine bagels in the morning, but lunch dessert cookies should be upgraded. Appreciated the snorkel gear & fresh water showers furnished. The ferry crew was completely professional but also extremely congenial, well-informed about the voyage & all aspects of the destination, & willing to share their knowledge. We rode outside going which meant eating without a table; coming back those sitting there got lots of hot sun & a brief rainstorm. We ate lunch inside the air-conditioned main cabin. On the return voyage, we opted for the smaller upper indoor cabin where a group of 10 started drinking as soon as the bar there opened & until it closed. They were not obscene or inappropriate but VERY loud & frequently moving. The gals were actually rowdier than the guys. We eventually fell asleep for a while, so It didn't bother us enough to move downstairs. At that time it would have been a challenge to find a place together. . The crew had stressed that passengers should not take up extra seats; I'm sure they would have found us seating if requested. Best advice is to board early. We have no regrets about the cost. It is a rare national park unlike others. The value is good for a full day of safe, worthwhile experiences on the sea with meals compared to many commercial tourist activities. And seniors who are active but have back issues do better on boats like this! It was as cheap for us to take a taxi from our B & B as to use the all-day parking lot.

Regardless of how much time you actually spend, you're going to see some wonderful sights. It's going to be relatively slow going because there's tons of cars taking their time so it's best not to be in a hurry. It's not crowded in the Yellowstone crowded and there are plenty of turn-outs so it's extremely pleasant. You'll see tons of prairie dogs, hopefully a lot of buffalo (although we only saw two!), wild horses, and hopefully other critters. Even if you don't see a ton of animals, the scenery is worth the drive. If you have time, do the drive twice, especially if you can do it later in the afternoon.

        "text": "Our family of 5 (kds ages 13, 16 and 22) did a tour of the Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Park area in June of 2013. We were coming from Yosemite (via Fresno) so entering at Kings Canyon and then going over to Sequoia was a good plan. We spent a day in Kings Canyon and then a day in Sequoia National Park and that was enough time to see the major attractions. The Giant Sequoai's are the main attractions at both parks and these groves alone are worth the trip as these trees are truly majestic and immense in size (the largest by volume in the world). The drive into and out of Kings Canyon is also a great drive with a lot of scenic overlooks and then the road follows the canyon floor and the river towards the end. There are several great hikes to do in both parks. The meadow trail in Kings Canyon is very nice as the views are excellent and the birds and wildlife on the loop trail are diverse. There are seveal longer hikes that looked good in the canyon but we ran out of time. The Grant's grove in Kings Canyon is home to the General Grant tree which is very impressive as is the dead tree in the Grant Grove that has been there for hundredes of years as the trees decay at an extremely slow rate due to their high tannin levels that ward off insects and degradation. I would allow for a full day in the Canyon staying at the lodge in the back of the canyon and then drive over to Sequoia the next morning and stay overnight in the Three Rivers area the next day. In Sequoia there are several groves of giant trees including the General Sherman (the largest tree in the world by volume). The walking trails are farily flat and some are paved in this area so there are hikes for every level of hiker. The Giant Tree Museum is very intersting and I recommend stopping for 30-45 mins to read all about the giant trees and learn a lot of neat facts about them. We also did the Meadow trail and saw the house built out of a fallen redwood at the end of the meadow trail which was amazing it has lasted so long and that someone lived it in every summer for multiple years. We also saw our only Black Bear on our trip to CA that included Yosemite and the Kings Canyon/Sequoia area so the family was happy they got to see a bear. The two days in the two parks was the right amount of time and then we flew out of Bakersfield on United which gave us a shorter drive then driving back to San Fran (where we flew in) and I was able to get better prices then flights out of Fresno which is the closest airport to the parks. FYI-the entrance fee to Kings Canyon and Sequoia are combined so once you pay the entry fee for the week it is good for both parks.",

Bus rides are included in the entrance fee, as are ranger talks both in town and at the battlefield. Was there on the July 5 and the busses were overloaded (rangers blamed the sequester for lack of staff and more buses), but folks were patient. The town has Civil War era restored interior buildings as well as modern day eateries, souvenir shops, a great bookstore with DVD and CDs as well. There is unattended river access, so be careful with your kids. You can watch the tubers, rafters, and kayakers go by. Those tours are purchased outside the park. Well worth the visit, probably much better not close to a holiday. The town is on the side of rock slab mountains, so be prepared to hike up and down hill.

The roads start of with 4 lanes and wind up with 2 lanes,and then become like the roads in Acadia National Park in, Maine. When you get close to crater lake you drive through a road that is bordered by very tall trees. The ride is tedious and you wonder what happened to a nice 4 lane highway, but the trip is well worth it. A gorgeous ride up to the park gets you to the toll both. If you don't have a Senior Pass it will cost you some dollars per car load. After the Ranger gives you a map and brochure you drive up a winding road and then search for a place to park your car. You walk over to the rim and the view is SPECTACULAR!! The is a beautiful dark blue that is rich and deep. Since this is a lake that formed after a volcano erupted eons ago, you find out that it is the deepest lake in America. The view is spectacular and there is a Trolly that will take you around the rim. If you are adventurous you can travel to the bottom and take the boat ride that is offered around the lake. If you are in the area take some time to visit this natural wonder.",

They have been selling out for the day before noon. They were supposed to be doing road construction and work on the parking lot, but thankfully they are not. We took the scenic tour which is nice but beware; there are 736 steps on this tour, and they run you through FAST. There is hardly any time to actually LOOK at the cave, because they run you through it at a high rate of speed. It's also wet, and the handrails they want you to hold on to are wet, which to me makes for dangerous walking conditions. The ranger got rude with us when we lagged behind the front part of the group, but honestly I wanted to look at the cave AND was trying to be careful because it was wet. Overall it was interesting, but I don't need to see it again.",

It is cool to see the carved faces of some of our greatest presidents, it gives you that patriotic feeling. And it is amazing that something that massive could have been carved. You can see the monument from the road and that might be enough for some people. I'm glad we paid the parking fee (however I wish it could have been covered with our America the Beautiful pass). The walk way with all the state flags s a nice touch and l gives presidents a nice frame. To be honest to look at the monument doesn't take that long, and we took the walkway around the base just because we felt like we should spend more time after paying for parking. The walkway was nice, and gave us different perspectives of the monument. If you take the trail start out to the left (while looking at the monument head on) it is less steep than starting on the right. If I was in the area again, I would be content with looking at it from a roadway pullout. The drive through the forest to get to the monument was pretty.",

Its a typical turn of the century furnished house, with some stories to go along. Next stop was the ranch 15 miles west of town, started the tour at the schoolhouse, then the birth home, then circled the ranch to the \"hanger\" which is a display and where you pay to tour the \"Texas White House\". The house is very 1960ish in its furnishings and decor (which doesn't seem all that old to me, but I'm in my 50's); still its interesting. historic, and very much worth seeing. It was a 100 degree day, so we didn't walk the grounds much, but it seem liked it would be a good thing to do on a spring or autumn day. All in all pretty good, but you leave wishing there was a little more to do or see after driving all the way out there.

But about 1 minute before our tour was to begin the ranger that gave us the tour said we had to take them back to our car which was not parked very close. So to be safe just leave all small packs and purses in your cars. The cave is fairly cold at about 49 degrees so be sure to take in a coat. If you have younger kids there is a junior ranger program that is not too hard. They do not take reservations anymore so if you are tight on time you will want to get there first thing in the morning.

As a concept, it is inspirational and it just has to be seen in place. The sculptor's studio was particularly interesting, and the distant views around the area and from the Cody state Park were memorable. The car parking charges are a minor gripe - they seem quite high especially for National Park pass holders - but it has to be said that the arrangements are first rate. Definitely an experience not to be missed, with the bonus of being in a beautiful part of the USA.",

I'd recommend to keep going to the other overlooks because they do get better. My favorite was of the Painted Wall. It is basically a flat piece of the mountain that has all different patterns from molten seeping into the surface millions of years ago! I'd also recommend taking the curvy road down to the water.

We arranged to eat our breakfast at the hostel (an old ski lodge-from Olympic trials or? .. it seems), and ate dinner we prepared there. Saved alot of money, saw incredible animals, did alot of hiking, went to top of Jackson Hole Ski Resort (a little spendy but well worth it). the Hostel was pretty sparse, it had small bathrooms, the rooms were narrow, dark, with only one window, might be some dust in the corners, no desks or swimming pool here, but they were comfy. It had bunk beds, the floors creak --creaks alot, a large rec room in basement with a large frig for all to keep their groceries (all were labelled) and rec room included a toaster, a microwave, lots of tables and a tv, a ping pong table, and more games that i can imagine, a table just for checkers and chess. OK..it wasn't the Marriott, but neither were the prices. Alot of younger college age kids working at the place, my kids made friends with some at the front desk, and they liked their dog Cinch. I saw quite a few families, and older couples who look like they were in good shape and maybe retired but saving money while visiting the area, also saw plenty of Foreigners who know how to stay in hostels. Grand Teton NP is just up the road from the hostel, as well as Jackson Hole which has a cute historic downtown- our kids did a stagecoach ride, short and sweet for $4/each, and check out the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, too. We did alot of hiking in Grand Teton, ate lots of PBnJ sandwiches, baby carrots, string cheese, beefsticks, and always brought our own water bottles. Loved this area!!",

The Presidential Trail is a must too. It gets you much closer to the monument and boulder field and affords you a number of less-cliched photo opportunities. We arrived a little before 7:30 on July 15th which gave us plenty of daylight to walk the Trail and be in our seats by 8:25 for the 9pm night-lighting program. If you want a decent seat, get there by 8:30. Like a movie theater, the prime seats are in the middle and upper areas. You probably don't want to be right at the front, and that's what was left by 8:45. The program featured a brief talk by a ranger (including reciting the Gettysburg address), a video about the four presidents, the lighting of the monument and the retiring of the flag with the help of all the active and retired military members in the audience (which was a really nice touch). We bypassed the visitor center but spent a little time in the gift shop and restaurants and both were perfectly fine and exactly what you would expect.

We then drove back to Sipapu bridge and hiked down to it. Sipapu is probably the most impressive of the three bridges, but the entire park is scenic and well worth a visit. If one does go hiking, take plenty of water. Even though we were there in late May the weather was quite hot. Sitting under Kachina bridge in the shade was a pleasant spot for lunch.

The caves are breath taking! It is cool inside of the caves, which was a welcomed break from the intense heat outside. The tours are very well organised from start to end which is perfect and to be able to say you ate lunch in a cave is pretty fun. In one part of the cave there is an opportunity to buy a lunch box, which includes a drink, sandwich, fruit and crisps and a very reasonable price. I will return again in the near future, it is a must do for any nature lover out there, the bus from the centre to the cave was beautiful also as you get to drive through some of the park, and we saw some native wildlife on our journey including deer! Make sure you get there at a good time as the tours sell out fast! Definitely worth the trip!",

It is a quick 60 to 90 minutes from Baltimore and Washington D.C. and a great place for a one day or weekend get-away. The views of the town and rivers as you drive in from Maryland are in themselves worth the trip. And yes, there really is something for everyone. Lots of hiking trails with georgeous scenery for both serious hikers and strolling types, kayaking and tubing on the Potomac and Susquehana rivers, The Appalachian trail, even a trestle coming out of a mountain side with trains coming through every 20 minutes. Of course the big attraction is the history, and being a National Park, other than the entrance fee, everything is free. Don't miss the historic negro Storer College, or Jefferson Rock, or talking to the historically outfitted re-enactors. There are lots of short programs to take part in within the various buildings. And don't forget to take a stroll through the historic town of Bolivar which is literally right next door.",

But the town has a much longer and important past than that, as a port of trade on the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers, and industrial center since the 1790s. You can fight for parking at the Lower Town or, recommended, head to the visitor center for orientation and info and a shuttle which drops you at the beginning of the town. The national park incorporates preserved buildings from mid-1800s, which are interspersed with park concessionaires and current non-park businesses. It's time-traveling into the middle of the town. Say you've been on the Appalachian Trail by accessing it via the old steps right here. The whole old town was a nice surprise. A good spot for young and youngish families. standard national park entrance fee, but great for us retired folks with Golden Eagles.

We went on the most popular tour which was perfect for our entire family. They have various options depending on your desires to cave. Only down side is that tickets must be purchased in person at Jewel Cave. I called from Custer, SD and was told that there were 19 tickets remaining for the last tour, but I needed to head directly to Jewel Cave. They could not hold the tickets or take payment over the phone. We traveled from Custer to Jewel Cave to learn that there were only there remaining tickets when we arrived. We had a party of six and we all wanted to go....That was disappointing!!! The next morning we went there first thing and were able to get tickets no problem. Could be a problem for someone traveling farther that 20 minutes!! This is something that the NPS needs to address. Otherwise it was one of our highlights of a great family vacation!!",

The signage is very informative about varieties of plants, rocks and desert changes. Paved road lead to northwestern entrance/exit with many more places to explore in the northwest and temperatures decreasing slightly. Two gallons of water per person per day is the quantity suggested by the park when hiking and exploring.

The Battle of Saratoga is always one of my favorite topics to discuss due to its importance in helping us convince other countries in the world that the young upstarts in America could possibly defeat the most powerful military in the world. Therefore, I decided to pay the actual site of the battle a visit this summer in order to get more material. I was not disappointed. Check out their website first in order to plan your trip accordingly. The site was very helpful. The grounds are beautiful, with incredible sights and parklike vistas. I was shocked at how empty of visitors the place was (it was a Tuesday though). This made for a very peaceful trip. Important areas of the battlefield are signed. A CD is available for a small price to help explain these areas in greater detail as you drive from place to place. Basically, if you have been to the Gettysburg battlegrounds, consider this seld guided tour a smaller version of that trip. Be sure to check out the fiber optics interactive map that explains the battles first. This is a very original idea and can be found in the visitors center. I also recommend traveling to the Victory Woods after your tour. This site is just north of the battlefield and is where the British finally surrendered. Basically, if you like U.S. history, military campaigns, and enjoy taking your time walking around the actually places these events took place while reading signage about those places, then this is a trip worth taking.",

They have 2 different garages to park in so parking is not a problem. You then walk into the viewing area of the monument. They have the visitor center, a place to check out head phones to listen to the tour, and when you walk further down, they have a gift shop and a food stand and restaurant area. After you pass all this, you walk the row of flags to get to the viewing area. They have a short hike you can take as well, but you can't actually climb on the heads or anything like that. As this was the main highlight of my cross country trip, I was a bit disappointed. It really wasn't that much.

You take an elevator down to start the tour and there are lots of steps up/down but it was totally manageable for us. There was one woman in our tour who had asthma and hadn't brought her inhaler and she was having trouble, but everyone else was fine.

It's truly huge and amazing to imagine how it was carved. The site is well organized and nicely layed out too. It's technically free but $11/car to park (so I suppose if you walked there it would truly be free ;) but totally worth the money. Seeing it from a distance as you drive up is cool too. When you get there and park, you walk in to an area with all the state flags, which is nice, and then out to a platform that overlooks the amphitheatre (there is a show there at night but we didn't go). Lots of people take photos there but it's crowded and there is a better photo spot later. The Presidential Trail walk is worth doing - it's easier (fewer stairs) if you start it from the left (when looking at the amphitheatre). It takes you closer to the monument and also passes the sculptor's studio, which is interesting. At the end there is a path to the right to an overlook that is a better place for photos.

The park covers a great portion of the Cuyahoga River Valley and runs parallel to the Ohio and Erie Canal, which was built in the early 1800's and is responsible for making it possible to settle the Ohio wilderness. The park boasts a great number of attractions and activities for all. Hiking and bike trails, Skiing, Wetlands, several Waterfalls, The \"Tow Path Trail\" (which was the original tow path that the mules trod upon for pulling the canal boats along the canal) is very flat and well suited for hiking, jogging, bicycling and sight seeing. Along the towpath trail are the remnants of the old canal locks as well as many of the historic building and stores and villages built along the canal, etc. There is also the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad which runs along the 26-mile length of the park 3 times daily with stops along the way, including the historic sites of Hale Farm, the old train depots in Peninsula and Independence, etc. If you have a family and you haven't a lot of money to spend on a vacation, you should really consider Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Hotels in the area are inexpensive and there is absolutely NO ADMISSION FEE for the park and most of the activities (though there is a charge for snow-skiing and the train excursion, etc.).",

This was one of my projected highlights on a tour filled with bucket list highlights, and being a historian l had a real sense of anticipation as we arrived at the site. That anticipation is heightened as you pass along a pathway lined with state flags and plques identifying each state and the date it entered the union. At the end of the pathway you emerge on a viewing platform where the carved faces of Washington, Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Lincoln appear before you. I was prepared to be wowed, but at first glance this carving in the mountain, as beautifully detailed as it is, left me a bit disappointed. Perhaps my expectations had been too high; the carving is considerably smaller than I had visualized in my mind's eye, and when the Crazy Horse Memorial is completed, it will dwarf the carving of the presidents.",

We have seen the transformation of this historical site. I remember seeing Ms. Lady Bird outside their house while our tour bus was passing thru. Now that she has passed, we take self tours with our out of town visitors. It is very easy and convenient. You stop at the LBJ Boyhood home in Johnson City first then drive to the ranch. We stop at the visitor center to pick up a CD which will instruct and guide you throughout the park in the convenience of your private car and company of family and friends. The LBJ house is partially open now. Every year, they add a room or two available for public to see. A nominal fee of $2.00 or $3.00 is paid prior to entering the house. It is educational. The place history buffs will enjoy. Donations are accepted. There is a drop box for the CD at the end of the tour. You do not even have to go back to the Visitor Center. How cool is that?",

Exit Glacier is approximately 11 miles from downtown Seward. It is an easily drive or bicycle ride from the town. The road is mostly flat. No entrance fee is charged at Kenai Fjords Nat'l Park. There is a visitor's center which was staffed by helpful rangers. A small gift shop/bookstore is located inside of the visitor's center. The rangers can provide you with a trail map. There was a guided walk that was leaving as we arrived that went to the edge of the glacier. We decided to do a self guided hike to the edge of the glacier. There is a 1 mile accessible trail that makes a loop from the parking lot to view points of the glacier. A 1/4 to 1/2 mile trail that leads to the edge of the glacier connects to the accessible trail. There are information boards along the trail that explains about the glacier and the National Park. There are also signs that show where the glacier was located in past years. It's really sad to see how much the glacier has receded in the past few years. At the end of the edge of the glacier trail, you can get fairly close to the glacier. I thought that we would be able to touch it, but it has receded too much. This area is definitely a beautiful place to visit. Unfortunately, I believe that Exit Glacier will cease to exist in 10-15 years. Visit before it's gone. We would love to come back sometime and hike the trail to the Harding Ice Field. We were unable to this time because not everyone in our family was able to hike such a strenuous trail. We didn't see any bears in the park. Overall, this is a nice place to spend a few hours and enjoy nature.",

A person can just go and look and be satisfied or spend hours here. We went down to the sculptor's studio which involves going down and up several flights of stone stairs, but it is manageable for most. At the studio, a guide gives about a 15 minute talk on the history and making of the mountain. It is well done and not tedious. We then walked the trail that views the other side of the mountain (to get a better view of Lincoln's face). There are many vantage points from which to take pictures, both on and off the property. (I think my husband got them all!) There is an $11 fee which, when paid, is valid until the end of that year. This is a must-see if you are near the Rapid City area.",

We went straight away in the morning to do a hike from Sunset Point. We left the car and walked clockwise, Queens garden, Navajo loop and the rim. We are experienced walkers so it took just over 2 hours round trip. This walk takes you right down into the canyon and so one must remember if you go down you have to walk back up. It might be tough going for young kids or the elderly or people with any heart convictions. Otherwise a must as this canyon is fantastic and you see lots of wildlife on the way. We then had a picnic at Sunset Point. There is a small general store to purchase snacks pizza or soup should you desire. We then drove to all the other viewing points starting with Rainbow & Yovimpa Points . Each one special with something amazing. My personal favorite viewing point was The Natural Bridge. The light was stunning (late afternoon) and we got some fantastic photos.. There is a shuttle bus but it doesn't go to all the viewing points so check before you leave the car parked for the day. Take as always lots of water, sun cream, hat and a map and .......Have fun!!",

        "text": "One of the main reasons we wanted to visit the big island is to go to Volcano National park. The park has some rally amazing views. The crater rim road is partial closed but still can get to the Jagger Museum and the other side connects with the chain of craters road. If you take the chain of craters road all the way to the end the road stops because of the Lava flows. Along the way there are interesting stops and short walks and hikes. You can get some trails maps at the visitor center. If you can I would recommend that you get your own car so you can do things at your leisure and not be rushed. The island is big and to save a lot of driving I would also recommend staying on the Hilo side a few days the village of Volcano has a number of rentals to stay at. There is a lot to see and you get a sense of old Hawaii and you can eliminate a 3 hour drive just to get to the park. We actually went to the park a couple of days. Over a half day we did the crater rim area and see the sulfur springs, Thurston Lava Tube, devastation trail and the Jagger Museum. The next day we did the chain of craters road. There a number of short hikes we did enjoy the Kilauea Ike Trail which is about 4 miles to complete the loop. At the end of the day we had dinner in Volcano Village and then went back a dusk to see the glow from the Caldera. My kids really did enjoy the park the highlight was to see the glow at night. I think they would have liked to see some real lava flows but that takes a pretty long hike to go to that area a stop at the historic Volcano House is nice and they have a better gift store than the Visitor Center. Also the Volcano Art Gallery is a nice place to stop by and look around. I would recommend a specialty tour for that activity. The other ways to see the lava is to take a helicopter ride or a lava boat tour. If you do a full day trip to the park I would recommend getting cheap Styrofoam cooler at Wal-Mart for $9 so you can put some water, fruit and sandwiches. We picked up some subway sandwiches so we can have lunch in the park without having to leave. Not much to offer in the way for food or snacks in the park unless you pay for an expensive lunch or dinner at the Volcano House. My wife and I were here in the mid nineties and the whole crater rim road was open and the lava flows covered less of the road so we almost drove up to where the lava is entering the ocean. Today it is about a 7 mile hike. If you have time a drive down to Kalapana is cool and you can see the other part of the lava flow which is not in the national park. There are some tour offered from that side and since it is on private land they have the permits to take you to the ocean opening. It is shorter hike from that side. There was something different this time. The fact that the crater rim road was closed because of vog seemed weird since it was not really blowing on the road. I can see if it does but when it doesn't why not open it. The activity today is far less than it was before and the road was open before the government always trying to protect you. Also we noticed there were a lot of rangers milling around and really did not seem to interact with people like they did before. I tried to ask a few questions and I barely got an answer. Even with the changes it is worth a visit and try to plan your day so you can take a short hike or walk so that you get a better sense of the power that the volcano has and how it has shaped the islands.",

When you first get there, you can visit the visitor center and watch the 17 minute movie on the history and science of the dunes. The visitor center offers a wide variety of interactive displays that teach you about the dunes and the wildlife that lives there. After that, you can purchase a pass to enter the park at $3.00 per person, unless the ranger isn't there, then you just drive in. White Sands offers many little hikes throughout the 7-8 mile driving loop. You can bring your lunch and your saucer for a day of fun! The saucers are used to slide down the sand dunes, similar to snow saucers. You don't even need to wear shoes! The sand is so soft. No matter how hot it gets, the sand does not get hot, but if you're there in the winter, the ranger said to wear 2 pairs of socks, because the sand gets so cold it could go through your shoes to your feet! Pretty amazing. During the summer, White Sands hold Full Moon Nights, three nights out of the summer. We attended this, and I highly recommend it. They have a band out there playing on the natural amphitheater the dunes create. The moon comes up and illuminates the dunes. At first, everything looks blue! It's so nice being our there at night. Definitely look into this if you plan on going in the summer. We also partook of the Sunset Stroll ranger guided walk. Our ranger was very informative and had samples of natural artifacts the dunes create and are created from. This stroll lasted about an hour and you don't walk very far. Check the visitor center or website for other ranger guided tours throughout the day. Have fun!",

The park rangers will take you on a tour of Fort Jefferson shortly after arrival. Your snorkeling gear is already paid for, so you can skip the tour and go straight to the water if you wish. There is a reef that you need to swim out a little ways to reach. However, if you don't want to swim too far or deal with a current, you can see a lot of fish by swimming along the walls of the fort. The BEST place to see a lot of fish is around the pilings -- you will see more fish there then you will at the reef. I was surrounded by schools of small fish. The store/gift shop is small, but they do sell cheap cameras as well as SD cards (-- I forgot mine). Be sure to wear sunblock! Boat debarks at 2:45 PM and arrives by 5:30 PM.",

HIghly recommend it.",

The morning of the cruise the fog started to lift and the grand mountains started to become visible. I was optimistic about the boat trip. When we arrived at the terminal we were told of a weather alert and that we may not be able to complete the trip. Not paying attention to other recommendations to cancel the trip (which was offered with a full refund) we decided to press on and try our luck. We were told that we would receive a partial refund if we weren't able to complete the whole tour, roughly 45 percent of the cost. As soon as we pulled out the fog lowered and the clouds and rain started. We got to the entrance to the Alaskan Gulf and the captain tried to cross into the next safe inlet. Other boats had tried and failed and we did too. We did see some marine life but very little on land. They still had our morning snack ready and we stopped for lunch instead of dinner on Fox Island. The food was good and it was warm and a nice stop. We still stayed out until around 3:00. When we returned to the dock I expected a huge mess and hours waiting to work out everyone's partial refund. Instead there was a full crew waiting for us with paperwork ready to sign. We received a prepaid debit master card which was issued in seconds with my signature. Although we probably should have cancelled the trip, I didn't want to miss out on any of the beauty and we took our chances. The company was more than ready to deal with the bad weather and appropriate compensation. Kudos, I wish every company did this level of class act when mother nature doesn't cooperate.",

The \"Historical Tour\" is the traditional one that is nice to do if you went when you were a kid. It is relatively easy and has a variety of different views. Last week we took the \"New Entrance Tour\" and that was just amazing. This tour is not easy, though - lots of steps, ups and downs, etc. However, if you can hike 2.5 miles without much difficulty then you can handle this tour. The tour had 3 parts - A, B and C. A was the climb down. 280 steps straight down with twists and turns and small spaces. Wear tennis shoes and even calf-high socks if you have them, as the back of my calfs were scraped from the steps down. You open-up into a large room, which starts B. B is climbing up and down and around with some beautiful sights. C is the Frozen Niagara, which is a mineral deposit that looks like a waterfall. They give you the option to take an additional 48 steps to go under the falls - DO IT. It was my favorite part of the tour and even though I was pooped by then, it was well worth it and not a lot of extra effort. Looking up at the falls - wow. They let you rest in between each stage and you're in a cool cave, anyway, so it wasn't too strenuous. And the Niagara is near the exit, you did your climbing-up in stage B. Each tour was about $12, I believe, and takes roughly 1.5-2 hours. You have guides with you. If you're vacationing anywhere near western Kentucky then Mammoth Cave is a must-do!",

Still worth the gruelling 23 miles unpaved part. Go REALLY slowly and you'll be all right. The ruins are spectacular; some are all excavated and you can wander around in them at your leisure. It's worth doing the hike up to the bluffs above Pueblo Bonita so you can see them from above; an incredible half circle of kivas and dwellings. We took in the astronomy presentation at the visitor's center one evening as well. Very basic astronomy, but you do get to look thru telescopes which is always cool. The campsite is basic and in a nice setting, cheap too. So glad I went.Spent 2 nights, May 31 st to June 2nd. Already hot; wouldn't want to come here in July or August. We did a 5 week road trip in the 4 corner states starting in early May and it was great, cooler and not as busy.",

First if you buy an annual national park pass, this park does not honor that for entry. Their \"claim\" is that they don't charge for entry only parking and its an \"independent company\" that collects the parking money, so even though its a national park you will pay $11 to get in even if you have the annual park pass! While we were there it was packed!! The kids exploration area was closed, so we were not able to do that. And, without paying extra for the \"tour\" Most of what you could do it hike around and take pix. By the way .... You can see a GREAT view from a pull off on the road coming in to the park and there are a lot of free places to hike while driving around the parkway roads. The only reason I can even give this a two is that there is a little movie you can see telling about Mount Rushmore and I've heard if you go at night it's fun to watch the lights, however we were not going to be there at night, so we were not able to enjoy that.",

There is no fee to get into Mount Rushmore, but there was a fee to park ($11.00). From the entrance, we walked through the Avenue of Flags, which was quite nice, with Mt Rushmore as the backdrop. We visited the Visitor's Center, where my son got a booklet to fill out to become a Junior Park Ranger. As we walked around, we found answers to the questions in the booklet. He then filled in the answers and turned it in to the Park Ranger at the Visitor's Center information desk. My son was then given a certificate & a badge & sworn in as a Junior Park Ranger. He thought that was awesome! We all enjoyed the information and displays at the Visitor's Center. Also, we walked the Presidential Trail, about as close as you can get to the mountain. I got some great pictures! The trail has ALOT of steps. The Sculptor's Studio was nice as well. I was very happy that there was a vendor table set up when we were getting ready to leave the monument that wasn't there when we came. The table was set up as a \"Guest Appreciation\" day and all the items on the table were being sold for $5. So we were able to score some Mount Rushmore t-shirts & coffee mugs at a great price! We were at Mount Rushmore about 2 hrs and as we were leaving, people were pouring inside the entrance. We were happy to have beat the crowd and people were waiting to get our parking space!",

At many of the viewpoints not only is the view fantastic, but the chipmunks and birds are good entertainment as the chipmunks will come right up to an outstretched hand.

You need to take a tour bus into the park which I highly recommend because many of the guides have spent time hiking, camping, etc in the park. Our guide Peter is a sub teacher in his other job but does this during the tourist season. He was well versed in the eco system, the animals, the history of the park and all that have traveled through the park since the early 1900s. You have the option of a 6-8 hr trip or a longer one. We chose the 6-8 hr because we do have an 8 yr old. We were even leery that he would hang on for 6-8 hr but let me tell you, he did and loved every minute of it. Part of the draw to this trip is that everyone on the bus participates in eyeballing animals. On our trip, we saw a momma bear and her 2 cubs whom gave chase to a male bear, caribou & their little ones, moose, porcupine, sheep and some birds. They film what you see on your trip and you can purchase that for $35-which they send to you via mail after editing. The mountains that you see throughout this great park are spectacular. They will take you to a spot to see Mt McKinley (aka Denali). This is hard to see in its entirety because of the clouds but we were able to see quite a bit. There isn't a bad Kodak moment and well worth the effort for the early rise. We did the early AM trip and when I say early..I mean..EARLY. They pick up at various large hotels in Denali starting at 530AM so be forewarned. Don't worry to doll up-no one will care at least I don't think so because I am sure I may have scared a few bear with my morning hair. The tour bus (which is a school bus configuration) we took included a light snack (reindeer sausage, cheese, bread, & bottled water). We opted to have our hotel pack us a lunch as kids aren't so thrilled with the bus snack option. They do make potty break stops often. Great trip for all ages.",

We didn't want to spend the $$$ in the restaurant, so we brought a picnic meal and that worked out fine. No refrigerator in the room though.

Having arrived so early, we did not have to pay for parking or entry- SCORE! Though some of the vendors and visitors centers weren't even open yet, we didn't find ourselves to be missing out on anything- the beauty and history was still there! Not a tourist in sight- just the serene hush of nature... 5:00 AM is the time to be there! Great memorial to say the least....",

While this is part of the National Park Service, many of the improvements to the memorial have been funded by donations to a non-profit support group and Xanterra. One of those improvements is a $17 million parking garage; so there is an admission charge for the parking garage of $11. There are no discounts for NPS annual passes, senior passes, etc. There are a number of exhibits and things to do, and a food court for meals. The evening program takes place in the amphitheater, includes a 20 minute movie that emphasizes the four presidents carved into the mountain side, lighting of the monument, and a special tribute to the veterans and active service members in attendance. While we didn't have time to do everything, we enjoyed the evening program.",

We arrived early, around 8:30 AM, which was great since it was not yet too crowded. The day was absolutely beautiful - clear blue skies (after a storm with hail and a small tornado the day before!), The carving and the overall facility is spectacular. The artist's studio is very interesting as is the walkway of flags. Entry is free, but parking is $11 per car which interestingly is good for a full year! The parking ticket has the date and most of your car license plate number on it, so if you wish to return, maybe at a different time of day (or dusk) or another day, parking is free IF you save your initial ticket. Access and viewing is easy although there are a fair number of steps down (and back up!) to the studio, but it\u2019s worth it. My only slight disappointment is that the actual carvings seemed a little smaller than I expected,, but yet it was spectacular and well worth the trip. I highly recommend it.",

To fully appreciate the motivations that caused the Minute Men to open fire I recommend coming to the Park from Concord Center (Wright Tavern, the British headquarters is still standing - although it is now a funky office building, so enjoy it from the outside.) If you travel up Monument Street to get to the Park you will pass by the Old Manse, which abuts the Park close to the North Bridge and is famous as the home of Rev. William Emerson (father of Ralph Waldo Emerson) who observed \"the Fight\" from his property along with his family.

There is an $11 parking fee but if you make the trip to this place it is more than worth it. There is no price for getting into the park. The park is beautiful! Also, there is a big gift shop that will sell you souvenirs (my recommendation is to get them elsewhere because they are expensive there) For those people that complain about souverniers not made in the US, then good luck finding any because everything has been outsourced by the US Corporations. The grounds have a great restaurant and great ice cream shop. There is a pathway to walk up and get really close to the faces. If you go to the right it is over 200 steps but if you choose the pat on the left it is an easy paved walk way. Like I stated before, an American Gem not to be missed.

Ruidoso is in the nearby mountains, has pine trees, and averages 20 degrees cooler temperatures. White Sands itself is unique and amazing. It is so beautiful, and I've never seen anything like it in the world. It has the largest white gypsum sand dunes in the world. The visitor center is a few miles southwest of Alamogordo. You won't miss it because there is nothing else there. The visitor center has a free 17 minute video that gives a good description of the dunes. It also has an outdoor garden of area desert plants with plaques and descriptions of those plants. I've always heard of creosote covered telephone poles, but never knew what creosote was. Creosote is one of the plants growing and described. The gift shop has plastic sleds available for kids to slide down the dunes. To get to the dunes, you must pay $3.00 per person, not per car. The older lady at the gate was extremely slow, but that is my only complaint. To get to the heart of the dunes you drive an 8 mile road. The first several miles are paved, then you drive on graded white gypsum sand. There was no problem with getting stuck in the sand. The first couple miles of sand dunes have quite a few plants growing on the dunes. The farther in you go, the fewer plants. Eventually you get to the truly white bare sand dunes. After you drive past the paved road you will see pullover areas to park your car. That's the place to get out of the car and climb some sand dunes. I'd say the average height is 30 feet or so, but some reach 60 feet, The contrast of the very white sand and the nearby blue mountains is so beautiful. Make sure to take photos. As I said, if it's summer and daylight, you won't want to stay a long time. It's hot. They do permit visitors until 10:00 PM though. Then spend the night in cool Ruidoso. If you want a longer side trip, check out Carlsbad caverns. Hope you enjoy it..",

The tourist center is first rate with a self-guided learning center (museum quality, very high tech use of computers and video). We chose the historic, 2-hour tour. It was reasonably priced and was conducted in a first rate manner. Be prepared, if you are not capable of walking 2 miles or are not comfortable in tight dark places, the historic tour is not for you. The cave is well lit for the tour and we got a chill in the cavern when they turned off the lights for the longest 2 minutes of my life. The tour guide does a good job describing the history of the cave. We were just amazed at the size of the fallen limestone that littered the ground off the trail. We'll go back to see the waterfall stalactites tour the next time. We had a blast walking through the skinny little caverns and low ceiling caves. And to top it off, we saw some little bats snuggled in the ceiling.",

Given that it is 91 miles from Kona- you think you would be there in about 90 min- give up that thought- the speed limit for a good part is 35- miles per hour. With the curving roads, change in speed- you are looking at about 2.5 hours maybe closer to 3 to get there. The first stop should be the Visitor's Center which is on the right just pass the information booth. If you are staying at Volcano House- it is across the street from the visitor center. At the center you can see a movie and get oriented to what there is to do. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE COMING. You may or may not be able to actually see lava- it depends on where it is currently flowing- this was upsetting to so many people we met in the center. Does it mean you can't see lava? No- currently you have to go outside the park to do it. So- know what you want to see and do before you get there. If lava is important- research how to get there (lava hikes with David Ewing is one resource).",

The parking lot is right at the visitor's center, and it does cost $5 per person to get in. The visitor's center has some displays to explain the native dwellings, but all of them have been reconstructed so I suppose it's our idea of what they looked like, not necessarily what they did look like. The trail goes down and around a tight bend in a dry river bed and then back to the visitor center. It has concrete steps and wide flat concrete or crushed stone pathways. Be aware, the trail isn't long, only about a mile, but it has a great deal of vertical relief (280') and you are hiking at 7000'. That means you are walking down and back up a 28 story building, so leave extra time and stay within your limits. The trail along the top rim is flat and easy to walk and you see everything, just not up close. We visited on Aug 17th and were treated to a fantastic storm. We arrived at around 11:00 A.M. and had finished by 12:00 noon just as a huge storm arrived. The lightning hit in the canyon several times and the rain poured for over 45 minutes. Then it started hailing and the entire area filled with white slushy pea sized hail stones. What a hoot! I suppose it wouldn't be so great if you were out in it, but from the huge windows of the visitor center it was FANTASTIC! When the rain let up we walked to the rim and saw the flash flood in the riverbed below. Even if you don't get the weather to cooperate for you the way it did for us, you'll still love the hike. Take water and sun screen if it's sunny and dry clothes if it looks like rain.",

Plan carefully if you have mobility issues, as the downtown area shops run up a very steep hill, and several viewing areas require long, uphill walks.

        "text": "My boyfriend, parents, and I stopped here on our vacation. Whenever we got there, the rangers told us that we probably couldn't go to any of the trails because of them were washed out because of the rain. They also told us that the mosquitoes would eat us alive even if we put on bugspray. They gave us a map and highlighted the trails that we could probably attempt (the boardwalk trails) and told us to bring plenty of bugspray. Their mosquito meter was on \"War Zone\" and it wasn't lying. It was awful. If you stopped walking, you were swarmed and bitten a zillion times. When you weren't walking, they swarmed behind you. We walked to the lake and back on the boardwalk trail. We saw where other trails were completely washed out which was scary to think that snakes and other critters could possibly be on the trail. We did see a big snake on a log at the lake. We also saw a lizard in the water on our way back. The whole park is swamp which was nothing special since we are from Florida so we didn't see any \"oooh\" or \"aaah\" from it. I rate the park poor because the trails were washed out, it was just swampland, the mosquitoes were awful, and it was dangerous that snakes could be on the trails. There were mosquitoes in the bathrooms but other than that the bathrooms were clean. The visitor center was nice and had a museum and a small gift shop.",

The historic tour entrance is walking distance from the visitor's center - no bus ride like some of the other tours. 2 hours sounded like a long tour, but the time passed very quickly and I was not bored in the least. Tour guide was extremely knowledgable and the cave was just fantastic. Not a whole lot of formations, but large, large rooms, and the history is very interesting. It is an amazingly big cave, though there are some sections on the tour where spaces narrow and ceiling heights come down. At 5'7\" tall, I had to duck in places, particularly some of the stairways, and the \"Fat Man's Misery\" section is curvey and narrow from about the waist down (several of us on the tour had to pass through sideways) but it's a short section and everyone in the tour group (all sizes and body types) all fit through.",

You should book in advance to ensure a seat, and the 2.5 Hour one way Catamaran ride is very comfortable. The price includes a Continental breakfast as soon as you depart Key West. The vessel has comfortable seating both indoors and outside top/bottom deck. Once at the fort, the snorkeling and turquoise water is fantastic. Use sunscreen as you are guaranteed a nice burn for this full day of relaxation. A good sandwich lunch is also provided at the boat docked at the fort. For the return trip back to Key West, enjoy the daiquiris for sale on the Catamaran. The journey on this trip is as close to the Caribbean as you can get.",

The station is a small building on a long paved roadway about 1 hour away. We waited for the train about 55 minutes. We would have preferred to wait on the deck of the lodge and the beautiful vista than along a roadway with bus fumes. Boarding the train was easy as seats were already assigned. Had to show a photo ID to board. Drink service was at your seats. Meal service by appointment was downstairs. Live commentary for the entire trip by Helen. She had fun stories to tell. They did not allow the large camera bag on board with a couple of other larger rollies. They stowed them in a small compartment right by the door. We had Chena Club car \u2013 Row 16 ABCD. The car was actually Holland\u2019s car, not Princess. So far the left side, seats AB, were the better side for sites along the river. The windows are large and you can see views from either side. The ride was fairly smooth and quiet with a large comfortable area for your legs and feet. There was the ability to climb over the person sitting next to you without disturbing them. We did notice that towards the back of the car it was nosier with plate/meal service noise. And towards the front the blender noise for mixed drinks was prominent. Abby was our drink server. Smoothies were $4.75 and very good. There is a total of 22 rows, 4 across.",

We just took the \"New Entrance\" tour in August 2013. It's a great tour because it covers some of the features from two other tours. It gets chilly underground, so you may want to bring a sweater...even in the summer! And gym shoes because it can be damp and slick. The tours are cheap, and the guides are great. Unless you can't walk or handle the thought of being underground...I can't think of any reason not to go on a tour. There were folks of all ages on our tours and not once did anyone have a problem.

        "text": "Chaco Canyon has been on my bucket list for a very long time. We finally made the day trip out there from Albuquerque - about 3 hours one way. Best to go I-25 north to US 550 northwest, and then south on CR 7900 (just like they suggest). BUT . . . that dirt road at the end was brutal. I called in advance just to check if my Toyota Sienna minivan could make the trip. The woman who answered at the Visitor's Center told me she makes the trip in her Nissan Sentra. So we gave it a go. I would NOT do that again in our vehicle. I would make sure you go in a 4x4 or in something with superior suspension/shocks. The grading on the dirt road (the final 13 miles before entering the park) is so awful that it nearly rattled the teeth out of my skull. At times I could only go 5MPH because of the continuous, tiny bumps. I'm not exaggerating. The bumpiness was so bad that it rattled the DVD right off the ceiling of our car! So . . . getting past that, Chaco Culture Park is simply amazing. If you're into history, architecture, ancient culture, etc. then you MUST see Chaco Culture. $8 park entrance fee for one vehicle, good for a week. We brought our 3 very young kids and they had a blast. It's mostly safe for them to run around, especially within the maze-like complex itself. But keep an eye on the little ones because there are some spots where they could have a serious fall if they take the wrong step. I guess that advice is true for adults, too. I didn't realize it until after, but this could make for a fun overnight camping trip, too. Check with the visitor center for availability and price, but there are several camping spots available. You park inside the park and pitch your tent right there. There are toilets and running water, but nothing else. So be prepared to pack in your own food. To sum it up, Chaco Culture National Historic Park is amazing and we are so glad we finally made it.",

I saw a lot of people taking pictures from the side of the road outside the park and basically saw what we saw. It is not the $ it is the principal. We saw a video while we were there and that helped ease the pain. LOL.",

        "text": "Nice day trip, 2.5 hrs, boat very smooth and we had pretty nice weather. Boat seemed to move quicker than we imagined. Breakfast began shortly after boarding and consisted of cold breakfast, bagels, butter, jam, fruit, lunch meat, coffee, juice, hard boiled eggs, good for cold breakfast and had plenty to eat, wished they would have had toaster for bagels or toast as they aren't too good cold. We were a little disappointed in only having a few hrs on island to explore and snorkel, after a very short tour with the guide of the Fort, we felt we didn't have time enough to even walk all around the fort if we wanted to snorkel and also had to return to the boat before 1pm to eat lunch.. Had hoped to be able to walk all around the fort and in the office there, ran short of time as we wanted to snorkel. Snorkeling not so good outside of the pilings around the fort. Pilings had quite a bit of coral to see and we saw a larger tarpon and Permit fish along with many very small fish. I guess we expected a little more brilliance in the fish and those we did see were very small. A few said they had seen some larger fish. Area around pilings is the best place to see anything. It's approx. 5-9 ft would recommend that inexperienced swimmers use a vest provided by boat to help keep them above water. Waves kept bouncing us back and forth around pilings so it was hard to get good underwater pictures and hard not to get pushed into the pilings at times. The guide was fairly fast on tour of the fort, however they do not go around the entire fort and if you want to explore the fort you must do so within the few remaining hours. We left feeling we did not get to see all of the fort, it's shop, etc. Arrived island approx. 10:30, obtained snorkel gear and then guided tour of fort, this all took almost 1 hour so approx. 11:30 we felt we had better eat before snorkeling so we wouldn't have to rush back before 1pm. If you didn't eat by 1pm there was no food later. Good decision to eat right after tour as bulk of the crowd returned to eat approx. 12pm. Longer line to get food, fewer tables, etc. After lunch felt we only had approx. 2 hours to snorkel or explore as had to turn in snorkel equipment, change clothes, board by 2:30. We enjoyed the trip and would recommend it to others. Staff on boat were helpful and all very cordial. If I had to do again, not sure if I'd go again, but if so I may opt for the Sea Plane as it is only about $100 more and may provide more time on the island and believe it would be beautiful to see from the air. Lunch was also good, cold sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, salads, etc. Plenty to eat with decent variety of meats, drinks, etc. Wish lunch could be served on return trip to not eat into time on island. All personnel were very helpful, cordial, etc. On return trip they sell drinks, cocktails, frozen drinks, beer, some snacks but all to be paid for to include soda and water. Frozen drinks about $7. Bring change of clothes if you want, dressing rooms on island and the boat has outdoor showers to rinse off. It was nice to change to dry clothing for ride back. Sun is bright and suggest sunscreen. We enjoyed the trip just wish it was a longer day. We thought it was expensive, but figured that breakfast and lunch would have cost about $15-$20 each meal, snorkel rental, and boat ride, I guess if you look at it that way it is not so bad and it is something you most likely will only do once unless you are fortunate to be able to camp on the island. I think that would have been the best way to see it. If you have the time I would recommend doing a few day camping trip.",

However I would still recommend you at least walk down to each bridge as they each look far more spectacular when viewed from below rather than above. If however you want to hike the park there is a 8.6 mile loop trail which starts at Sipapu Bridge parking area. The 0.6 mile trail down to the bridge is steep, but has steps,ladders and rails - at the bottom the views are awesome. The trail then meanders alongside the stream, crossing it several times. The route was not well defined and in a number of places seemed to just disappear. If you persevere you will in 2.3 miles be rewarded with views of the Kachina Bridge - again spectacular. The trail goes under the bridge and up the left side of the canyon. It appears you are walking out towards the Kachina trailhead, but the trail does kick right back down into the canyon, this time following the stream in Armstrong Canyon. Again it meanders alongside the stream, crossing several times, it is not well defined and has very limited cairns. After about 1.5 miles the trail plunges into a deep part of the stream (thigh high the day we hiked) as we hadn't really been prepared for it and wasn't wholly sure this was the correct route we searched for alternatives for a while before turning back and exiting at Kachina trailhead. On our way back towards Kachina we passed a German family and advised them of the lack of defined trail and deep stream. They continued. We then visited the last bridge after making our back to Sipapu trailhead to collect our car. The hike down to Owachomo Bridge is short and relatively easy although I wouldn't recommend flip flops! Again the views are magnificent. At the bridge we met the German family who had waded thigh high through the stream, got lost a bit more and finally made it to the last bridge.",

This is a rural, national park, with great effort to keep it as pristine as possible. Appropriately, it is two hours from the nearest freeway. Views are fantastic and the rim drive is a good example of Civilian Conservation Corps construction from the 1930's. Spend some time to explore the park. There is a new, free and good video at the visitor center near park headquarters. There are lots of hiking opportunities, including one to the lake for guided boat tours (Advance reservations are required.) The facilities are classic and include the lodge with a spectacular view. The Lodge restaurant is expensive, $20-30 per person. The rim Cafe is $5-10 for very simple fare and prepackaged food. At Mazama village, 7 miles from the rim, there is a campground, restaurant ($10-15 per plate), cabin motor inn, small general store and gas station. If you can, attend a ranger talk at the campground amphitheater This is higher elevation 5-7,000 feet and the snow remains through July. So, take appropriate clothing; e.g. jacket for cool evenings in August. The lake can be clouded in often from fall through late spring. Often the \"fog\" doesn't burn off til mid afternoon. Winter time visitors need to be aware that one entry is closed. Check their website.",

Those trails are the climax of the park and are must sees. I would not recommend it for families with children under 8 years old. They should be mature enough to not play around as if you joke around you can fall off the cliff. You should be fine if cautious.

If you enjoy hiking, consider the Pass Creek trail. The trailhead is located very near the Coal Bank Pass rest area on highway 550. It is a high altitude and fairly steep trail (2300 feet in elavation gain) but after only about 2.6 miles you are near the base of Engineer Mountain and rewarded with amazing views in all directions. If you are more adventurous you can continue on a much steeper rocky trail to the summit of the mountain. We were there on Labor Day weekend so the trail was fairly busy but I imagine at other times (especially during the week) it is not very crowded. It is appropriate for older children who are used to hiking but not for younger ones.

As it was August and the weather was hot, we opted for buying the vehicle CD (about $15) and driving the park and stopping at the sites instead of one of the bus tours. The CD was quite informative and gave exact directions as long as you followed the 15 mph speed it suggested. We were ahead or behind on it but got back on track by pausing or sitting in the car a few minutes. There can be a lot of walking involved if you get out at each stop to walk around. Most areas are pretty pedestrian friendly. I happen to have asthma, so walking back up the hill to the parking area would have been asking for an attack if I had been alone, however, my boyfriend walked to the top parking area and brought the car down to pick me up. There is a cute little gift shop where you can get a hotdog and drink behind Washington Memorial Chapel, but otherwise, refreshments are pretty sparse until you leave the park. There is a covered bridge on the route that I suggest you cross and see some of the homes on that road, go as far as the park sign and turn around to come back. Some of them were used as headquarters and are not on the main cd tour but can be seen on the park service map (which you should get at the visitors center from a ranger). Overall, it was a very nice park. Most areas with buildings close at 5 or 6pm, so when we arrived on Fri and went to the park, we only had a short time to explore before things closed, but did a quick tour and went back on Monday to spend the day.

Glacier Bay, the Hubbard Glacier, at the stop in Skagway, we rode the train up Chillkoot Pass, retracing the trail that the many prospectors took on the way to the gold fields in the gold rush of 1898, 99. The crown jewel of the six days that we were on the land part of the tour was, for me Denali Park. What an immense park it is, and if one is fortunate, a view of Denali itself, capps a 60 mile ride into this absolute jewel. 30 percent of the visitors to the park get to see this huge mountain. Denali is the largest mountain on earth. Everest is taller as everyone knows, but in terms of mass, Denali is the biggest mountain on this planet.",

Denali as the local indigenous population call it) there is a fee to allow access to interior campsites or via NP buses to sites. We tried to see Mt.

The park is small and other than cave tours, those who aren't all that \"outdoorsy\" may not find much to do, but it's beautiful and the cave tours are worth the visit even if you do nothing else. We did the Historic Tour. I was a little worried because I'm a more-than-chunky guy at 5'7\" and 230 pounds (38\" waist), but I had no trouble at all fitting through the tight parts of the tour. I was a little worried about stairs since I'm out of shape, but even there, it's not too taxing for most people. Unless you struggle with stairs ordinarily (knee problems, very low stamina), I would say if you can handle an ordinary pace up a few flights of stairs, you will be okay. There are 155 steps at one point (in flights of maybe 10-15 steps each flight), but the pace is fairly slow on these as there are so many people taking them at once. If you are worried about being slow there, try to get to the front of the pack and you can allow people to pass you on the way up. At the end of that climb, you enter a cavern full of benches and sit to rest for several minutes while the Ranger talks; the average person won't need the rest, but for the few who might have trouble with the stairs, I suspect that's helpful.",

Because we went during the off-season our group was smaller than normal, and we made a few extra stops on the tour. Our guide Lydia was very knowledgeable, articulate, and had great stories to share being an explorer of Jewel Cave herself. Expect to see lots of crystal formations, and jewel like formations. The scenic tour itself is well planned with railings, stairs, lighting and concrete paths making it appropriate for people of all ages. The caverns are very, very large, so no real worries of claustrophobia. Being a government run sight means the entry fee is nominal. Lots of free parking, a little gift shop, interpretive display, and clear directional signage to get there. Check the website ahead of time for tour schedules to plan your trip. Bring your camera, but please leave the flash at home or warn people ahead of time when photographing with the flash to avoid temporarily blinding them.",

It was definitely a cool experience and we took some really amazing pictures of the crater. There are also a few rainforest walking trails which are also pretty neat. Even just driving though parts of the park (i.e going from volcanic to rain forsest) is pretty cool. Worth the trip.

We then went to the smaller city-operated site north of the Visitor's Center, small fee without Park Service pass. Lot less petroglyphs, fading, and because there are no interpretations, takes a lot out of what could be an informative look into the ancient past. Supposedly, current native Americans (1) won't reveal the meanings for religious reasons, and/or (2) don't agree upon the interpretations, and/or (3) don't the meanings.

It was a labor day weekend, we 3 families stayed in one of Trinidad's vacation rental (Retro Retreat $900) for 3 nights, we planned for 2 but the minimum was 3, in fact it turned out to be good other wise it would have been a exhaustive trip. On Day one we just roam around Trinidad, beaches, light house, Paticks Point, once passing Patricks point there is an RV park and old school museum where they do have a community music band and free food (you can donate $$ for the food) on weekends, we had great burgers and coffee, then proceed to Gold Bluff's Beach. It's a 20-30 minutes drive through the woods, slight rough roads and small creeks you can drive through. You need to walk down to see the fern canyon and water falls which is a mind refreshing experience, I would suggest plan for an afternoon at this place. We didn't that much time so we spent some time at fern canyon and didn't reach to falls as it was farther and park hours are about to close for the day. We had a close encounter with Elks at this place. Day two we took south to visit shrine drive through tree as we didn't know there was another one in Klamath, so that we could visit drive through tree and trees of mystery in one trip.It turned out to be good as this place has few parking spots inside the park. Even though the tree is supported by the cables and it's leaned to one side. It's not a tall tree, it's a hollow tree vertically (been cut off) and horizontally where you drive through.They are saying that the trunk of the tree has been burned off and fall down ~100 ft from the level. Tree is still alive and it has leaves and branches as well. I visited the leget drive through tree as well, more or less you 'll get the same feeling as you drive through the tree, if you expecting for a fully sized tree from top to bottom, it's not what it is. We still had time to spent but not enough to reach Klamath for visiting trees of mystery. So we took a tour through avenue of gaints and swim at one of the river passing near by. You can drive in to river and park next to the water. The water was not that cold too. We spent some time playing with water, and refreshing swim. Then we visited the one of the beaches at Crescent, it was early evening and a bit cold but kids enjoyed it's fullest as the beach is more of sandy than muddy. On day 3 we went to visit trees of mystery at Klamath, we could have do both day 2 and 3 in one day if we went to Klamath on day 2. On our way back we took a stop at Carson Mansion which is a really great place to visit.",

The only thing that still bothers me and always will, is the FEE that they charge to park!!! It's supposed to be a FREE monument / memorial but you have to pay $11 (2013) to go there!! What a horrible political move that was. They were building the new plazas and parking ramp when I was working in the Badlands in 1995 and I wrote several letters to the superintendent at Mt. Rushmore about it and was told that the then $8 parking fee would be dropped once the ramp was paid off. Well, now it's $11 and there's no end in sight. I guarantee that Mr. Borglum is rolling in his grave at this travesty to charge people to go to a \"free\" memorial to the four Presidents he took the last 17 years of his life carving. The guy at the entrance said that our $11 parking pass would be good for ONE YEAR, but on the back it says that it expires at the end of the year. They really need to get their act together on this, for those of us who might actually be back more than once a year it's really bad PR for those who run this otherwise breathtaking and mind-blowing carving. You will not forget seeing this whether it's your first time or your hundredth time. ",

No battles were fought here but this is where troops were properly trained and lessons in perseverance were learned. Valley Forge is easy to get to from the highway and entry is free. We arrived around noon and went to the visitor center. Be sure to ask where the kiosk is located where you can enter an ancestor's name to see if he was at Valley Forge. We purchased the self-tour cd for $16 (I would recommend this) and then we watched the free short video about Valley Forge and the Revolution and then walked with a Ranger to a few stops for about 1/2 hour. We took a break and drove to King of Prussia for a quick lunch (a few miles away) and then came back to start the self-tour. We ended up driving around the park until 5:30 p.m. and we didn't even get out to see everything. Washington's headquarters was at a good spot for us to stretch our legs after driving around for a while. This is a beautiful, peaceful park where it seems locals come to take advantage of the great spot to picnic or exercise. We did Gettysburg and Valley Forge in the same week and it is interesting to compare the two. Gettysburg is more hustle and bustle while this is more serene. Both equally nice. In retrospect, we should have stayed in King of Prussia afterwards because this was an all day event for us and that area looks nice and new with plenty of restaurants, hotels and a mall.

It's not a cheap trip, but it's well worth it. The boat ride was long, but we were fed a good buffet breakfast almost immediately after leaving the port. A decent lunch buffet is served while you are on the island. You can eat on the boat or take your food to one of the picnic tables on the grounds. when you arrive, I highly recommend taking the guided tour because you'll get to hear some very interesting facts and information. You'll still have plenty of time to explore on your own or visit the beach. You'll get a beautiful view walking the top of the fort, and walking around the fort along the sea wall was incredible. I would recommend grabbing a table when you arrive to put your belongings on while you're on the tour or exploring on your own. There aren't many tables in the shade but there is one that we grabbed right off the dock. The return boat ride was fast and very windy for about an hour. We had 4-6 foot swells, but even with all that, I saw no one get sick. There were plenty of seats inside and out. This is definitely a \"must go\" trip!",

Access to the park is quite easy and there is a fee to get in (look it up online), but the ticket you get is good for several days (you can\u2019t give it to someone else because your license plate number is on the ticket). There are several vantage points; an overlook point, an amphitheater, and a wooden trail that gets closer to the sculpture. One note for pet owners, dogs are not allowed. Make sure your digital camera is fully charged with plenty of room on the data card because you\u2019re going to take a lot of pictures. If you go early in the day there should be less of a crowd which should reduce the likelihood of someone photo bombing your selfie with the four presidents. Find another person (with an expensive looking camera) to take a photo of you and your significant other (don\u2019t ask), and make sure you return the favor. Be sure to walk the wooden trail that brings you closer to the rubble field below the sculpture. You\u2019ll get some good photo ops and it gives you a different perspective. They say the trail is strenuous\u2026if you\u2019re in reasonable health you\u2019ll have no issues. There are a lot of stairs so a wheelchair will not make it. There is a display at the end of the trail where you can try and heft some of the typical tools used to carve the mountain. It\u2019s amazing that they had a pump at the bottom of the mountain that ran a pipe all the way up to supply the air pressure to run all the tools. There is also a small museum and (larger) gift shop at the bottom of the overlook to get your fridge magnets and souvenir caps. It took us about two hours to see everything we needed to see, your mileage may vary. It is one of the top ten American icons that everyone should see, so make the trip. You won\u2019t regret it.",

The evening show is excellent. Host from National Park Service was great. Short movie on the Presidents and history including First Nations.

Recommend the movie to help explain the memorial, and also do the Presidential Trail walk (only a bit strenuous on the uphill portion). The walk gives you views of Mount Rushmore that are not available from the viewing platform. Did not get to see the lighting ceremony (nightly at 8), but am told it is very impressive and patriotic.

We drove a couple of hours from Eugene to see it and it was well worth it, just be sure you have plenty of gas! We left the interstate at Roseburg and drove hwy 138 through the mountains. Its a gorgeous drive along the river but there are no gas stations or restaurants etc along the way! If hou are a hiker there are many many trails along the way and in the park. If you do nothing in the park but drive up and around the rim you will need about 3 hours, however you could spend an entire day easily! This is a DO NOT MISS Oregon attraction! We made many stops along the way to the park along hwy 138 as well, and then drove back through Bend And Sisters Oregon. This route allows you to see more of the Cascade Mountain Range and the Lava Fields if you want to (unfortunately we did not have time to stop by them). Stopped for dinner in Bend at the Riverhouse on US 97. Beautiful dining overlooking the river and food was great. This entire round trip from Eugene took about 12 hours and we could have used much more time!! Missed several things we would have liked to have seen along the way! $10.00 fee to get in Crater Lake Park. Dinner at Riverhouse Any where from $15 for fish and chips to $30 for a big steak.",

If we could have afforded it we would have stayed here but unfortunately it was out of our price range. We headed east towards Moran Junction stopping turnouts at Willow Flats and Oxbow Bend, past Moran Junction to Snake River Overlook and Teton Point Overlook. Headed back the way we had come to Jackson Lake Junction and then south and up Signal Mountain. Onto our hotel Signal Mountain Lodge where we hired a boat and sped around Jackson Lake for an hour - excellent and would recommend doing this. Stayed at Signal Mountain Lodge, which was ok.

We did not know what to expect as we did not research this destination (which is something we normally do), but in the end it was one of the very best trip we ever took. We also took the scenic drive to get there (From Cedar City, Hwy 14 to Duck Creek, then north on Mammoth Creek Rd to Panguitch) which is a route we highly recommend. It also takes you through Red Canyon which is worth a trip all by itself. Getting into Bryce was easy, and once inside was not congested and we found parking at every stop. And while the Park is essentially a huge canyon, the drive is along the rim at an elevation of more than 9,000 feet in places. Bring extra batteries for your camera, as you will find lots of lots of photo opportunities. And bring a jacket, even in the summer, as the high elevation also means cooler temps. I would also recommend watching the movie in the Visitor Center as it helps explain the history and how the stone formations were created. - - As far as lodging, there are LOTS of (locally owned) motels and lodges along the way, but we did not see them on the sites we normally use for reservations and so we spent the night in Cedar City. That is too far away, and the next time I would put in a little more effort to make a reservation closer to the park. - If over age 62 or disabled get pass to enter park for free.",

A trail there will take you up Chicago Basin and over Columbian Pass at a little over 12,000 ft. One piece of advice go into Durango and buy a good trail guide book, and read it before deciding where to enter. This simple act will make your trip that much better. Also, buy the forest service pass or a fishing pass, it is about $15.00. BUT if you get into trouble, the search and rescue with a helicopter wont' cost you a dime.",

We planned it so that we would get there a couple of hours before sunset - giving us time to look around and then see the light show after the sun went down. The drive to the Memorial was beautiful, the parking convenient and the area well-kept and clean. There was a bookstore and food on the site. The walk-way was easy for people with mobility issues. It led straight towards the mountain, giving you plenty of ways to set up your photos, and was lined with state flags. I would have liked to have seen it the way it was before they put in all the concrete, concessionaires and $11 parking fee (your national park pass is not honored). We didn't take the opportunity to do so, but I understand there is a trail that takes you closer to the monument. There is seating on an upper level over-looking an amphitheater below. After sunset, a park ranger came out on the amphitheater stage and began a video that was part history lesson, part flag-waving rah-rah. The video concluded and he droned on and on about how we must put aside our differences as a country and come together as one nation. Huh????? I didn't expect to be chastised on my vacation! What a downer! Finally, they turned on the \"spotlights\" so that we could dimly make-out the faces of the presidents. What a let-down! Not at all what I expected and not something that I'll visit again. The next day, as we were driving along the scenic roads in the area, we came across numerous viewpoints to take better photographs than we were able to get at the monument itself.

They say that you should get your ticket by 1:30 if you want to get in same day. I went in October and it wasn't very busy, so it wasn't an issue. Before your tour, spend some time walking around, there are some interesting exhibits right near the hall, such as the President's house and the Liberty Bell. There will likely be a line for the Liberty Bell, so you might want to wait until after you get though Independence Hall before you queue up. The tour itself is 30-45 minutes; you're really just going through the two main rooms in the hall but the tour guides are clearly humbled to be giving the tours - they portray a sense of deference and decorum that's fitting for such a monumental site.",

Every time I have seen it I have not been disappointed. The one thing that is nice is that in the evening they have a lighting ceremony. The park ranger gives a talk about the history of the monument and pays respect to the veterans who also help in the flag ceremony. Every time I have been I have not been disappointed.

Hot Springs is about a four hour drive, but well worth the time spent. What a gem of a city! As the other reviewers have stated, the National Park is in the middle of the city, and it focuses more on the history and culture surrounding the Hot Springs and the industry of the bath houses that put Hot Springs, AR on the map. Definitely take the short motor trail up the mountain to the lookout. There is a moderate fee, but it is worth it. I particularly enjoyed reading each and every one of the placards in the tower. Bathhouse Row is lined with beautiful buildings with different architectural styles. Only a few are open, but the buildings are gorgeous. I would HIGHLY recommend partaking in an old fashioned bath spa treatment. If it wasn't for the video at the Visitor's Center of the National Park that depicted the elements of a typical bath experience, I would not have thought about doing it. My friend and I enjoyed the treatment at the Arlington Hotel since the Buckstaff Bathhouse was closing the day we visited.

        "text": "Do some minimum reading about what happened and how the history of southern Arizona was impacted by misunderstandings that started here. It can be well enjoyed without the preparation, but I'd encourage you to spend a few minutes researching \"Apache Pass\" and the \"Bascom Affair\" so that your walk into the fort can be best appreciated. This is really where the Apaches Wars began. There is a 1.5 mile hike into the fort from the parking lot where you'll find bathrooms. The fort path is an easy grade, well marked trail and you'll pass good historical signage that sketches out the significance of what you are seeing. Be sure to have some water. You'll come upon the ruins of the stage coach station where troops set up a defensive perimeter after attempting to hold the Apache leader Cochise for the kidnapping of a settler's child, an act that had actually been done by another tribe, but no matter, one Indian was as good as another. Members of Cochise's family were held as hostages when the warrior chief escaped. They were later hung in retaliation for the death of hostages held by the Apaches. Its not at all difficult to conjure up in your imagination hundreds of warriors on the ridge side and in the surrounding hillsides, looking down over the valley and its anxious soldiers. This is one of those rare battlefield sites that brings the events readily back to mind because of its uncorrupted condition. No commercial establishments or bill boards or telephone poles to be seen in any direction. My wife and I encountered a mounted ranger who commented that artifacts show up after every heavy rain. The sense of history is heavy and close. Walking to the fort you'll see the post cemetery and the location of a number of grave sites. One marks a medal of honor winner. Another marks a young child of Geronimo's who had been a favorite of the soldiers but died of sickness. The clear \"Apache Spring\" whose water made this site so vital for life still bubbles on. You're advised not to drink the water. The trek to the fort is uphill toward the last quarter mile. The original fort's ruins are to your right as you climb the last leg of the hill and provide a good vantage to look back over the valley trail. The more massive fort that served over decades of the latter years of the 19th century is directly in front of you, and there is a picturesque American flag flying from the flagstaff in the midst of the parade ground that you will spot from the trail. The fort is large and mostly in ruins. A small but appealing visitor center provides a shady spot to sit and drink. It also has first class bathrooms. When you leave, I'd suggest, if you're up to it, hiking back over the ridge trail that begins directly behind the visitor center. Its a steep and demanding initial push to get to the top, but from here you have one of the most impressive views of an Indian Wars landscape that will ever be your fortune to see. You are standing at the top of the Apache positions during the battle and there's a side trail to take you down to their view of the soldiers. If you turn 180 degrees and look east, you can see the flat plains across which came the stage coaches and freight carriers, headed for Apache Pass. The rest of the trail offer a series of switchbacks down to the valley floor and merges with the trail coming from the parking lot. This fort site and its southwest surroundings looks more like a movie location than an actual historic fort, but its authentic, down to the horned toad that stared me down on the trail. I kept listening for a bugle. Enjoy.",

This is a trip well worth it. They have wonderful visitor phamplets so bring about $4 in quarters if you would like to purchase them (about .50c each or .75). If you want to, return them for no charge. Bring a picnic lunch, walking shoes, blanket to sit on and water). There are decent bathroom facilities at the sites and a picnic table. Bring your camera! Do NOT stay at the close cities unless you can make a reservation at any of the bed and breakfasts. Do stay longer than one day if possible. The campground looks bare but has minimal facilities. If you want to stay in a nice motel/hotel go to Bloomfield, Farmington, Los Alamos or Santa Fe or Jemez Mountains. Bloomfield is by the Cumbres Railyard (steam train). Worth the money and the time. Enjoy your trip!",

The rest of the crew were VERY knowledgable about sea life, birds, and then the history of the Fort. The tour of it was about 45 minutes and then there was plenty of time to stroll around alone, take photos (and places to sneak a few *risque* ones if you want) and explore. There is ample time to tour, snorkel, laze in the sun, etc. The island is absolutely stunning, the views, snorkeling, beach, water.... Lunch on the boat is a nice picnic style- sammies, chips, veggies, sodas, sort of thing. The return trip was also just as good- with many more questions answered, stories told and cocktails enjoyed (extra $$, but fair). A great day long adventure, would highly recommend.",

The campground itself was OK if you like being on top of one another. The fee was only $10. per night. Luckily we were there in the fall when most people weren't camping anymore. Make sure to go to the visitors center first and do the bat screening. Once we asked what it was about we found out how important it was. They ask a few questions and then depending upon if you have been in caves back east you will need to have your camera wiped down and your shoes. Millions of bats are dying from a disease.

We had incredibly good luck in that we arrived on the first sunny, rain-free day they'd had in a long time. Besides the amazing rock formations and long, beautiful vistas, there is the opportunity to pick fruit at Fruita (apples and pears in mid--September), free to eat there or $1/lb to take with you. We also hiked along the river and then as far up the side of a cliff as we felt comfortable. The day was warm, but as we gained elevation, there was a strong, cool breeze. There were a few other people hiking, and a fair amount of traffic along the scenic route, but it never seemed crowded, and you could tell from the way the other travelers were soaking in the beauty that they were as charmed by this park as we were. We also stopped to see the petroglyphs, and drove far enough along the drive past Capitol Dome to see a tiny historic cabin. If you want a great overlook for an amazing view of this area, there are some not to be missed along Utah Highway 12. We arrived in the area via this road after dark, but backtracked to see the overlooks after exploring Capitol Reef. Definitely worth the twenty-minute back track, which was much faster when not dodging cows on the road in the dark! Reading some of the other reviews, there were enough things we missed that I would definitely return to this park again, and hope for another stroke of luck weather wise!",

Our hike took us to the canyon floor, a place the Ranger called the \u201cbadlands,\u201d a 700 ft. elevation change from the rim. You have to wait in line at the Visitor\u2019s Center the morning of the hike to get your free ticket. We got there at 5:30AM, and by the time the doors opened at 8, there easily were more than 60 people to take the 60 tickets they had to give out (two hikes went out that night). We probably could have gotten a ticket if we would have arrived at 6AM, however, during the summer months, the Ranger told us arriving very early is necessary, especially if you have a big group. You need to be wearing, or have with you, the shoes you\u2019ll wear (lug soles required) and everybody in your party has to be there to get their ticket. We\u2019re seniors (in our early 70s) and this hike was awesome; a definite Bucket List addition if you like the outdoors and rigorous activity!

The streets adjacent to the house are closed to traffic. Several neighboring houses have also been restored to their mid-19th century appearance and a few contain complementary exhibits related to the Lincoln Home. This is the only home that Lincoln owned and the family occupied it for almost 20 years. The house is furnished approximately as it looked in 1860 and contains some furnishings that belonged to the Lincoln family. The NPS guides are very informative although they may be rushed on a busy day. Tours are limited and require timed tickets available at the visitor center. There is a nominal fee for parking.

The lessons were all the more poignant coming in the actual school building where the case was brought. I did not know that Kansas segregated on a separate but equal principle that was actually close to reality unlike many southern states but the case was settled on the notion that separate meant unequal regardless the conditions and could not be sanctioned. The politics of the court first passing on the case and a Republican President appointing Earl Warren who effectively created a unanimous court decision a year later strikes me as a great irony, given the present day antics of Ike's party. Admission is free and there is a National Park ranger on the premises to answer questions. Allow 1-2 hours.

At Harper's Ferry a short walk from the bus drop off, see the the town as it was way back when. . . Walk along the Potomac River for some views, or over the river bridge to head up for some serious hiking. The town has lots of eating places, a few trinket shops, a wax museum, free entry to churches, old mansions etc. The hikes across the bridge are serious. The hike to look out Rock, which gives you view over Harpers Ferry is a favorite. It is 2.8 miles and lots of ups and downs, although it is mostly flat for walking. Good for all age groups, but you should be in pretty good shape and take water. The overlook, lets you look down on the reg. railroad tracks, and the passenger train track as well as the town. Parking is a rare commodity at Harpers although you can drive through it, but there is no place to park, so it only makes sense to go to the park headquarters to take the shuttle bus. The only cost is to get into the park for a cost of $10.00 which is good for 3 days. There was wheel chair access on the bus's. That is cool for the handicapped. This area is great for biking, since bikes can park anyplace.",

The downside: the first class cabins are more expensive, you need last car on train for standing on rear platform; first class has liquor for sale, and most of the guests in our parlor car were pretty drunk on the return trip, loud, and definitely lost their initial fear of stepping onto the back platform to look over the cliff down to the Animas River. The upside: because they were so drunk, they stayed inside the parlor car the majority of time drinking and partying, so we had the back platform to ourselves for most of the way up to Silverton and back to Durango on a fabulous sunny day for riding the train in the cool mountain air and sun!

Then we did two of the moderate hikes - you just have to go down into the canyon - don't just stay up on the rim. Getting down in there and being close to the hoodoos was so much fun! Be sure to pack plenty of water and pay attention to the 'grades' they give the hikes - easy, moderate, strenuous - they are right on the money. The second day, we drove to the far end of the canyon and then drove back, stopping at each and every lookout. Again, I couldn't believe how the views changed each time. We kept saying over and over again, \"This is my favorite view!\" We packed in our lunches both days, which made it easy to just stop and eat along the hikes.

Much of this is accessible along Rt 24 at no cost but even the scenic drive and access to some of the better hikes is only $5. Capitol Reef is named for geology; Capitol for the sandstone domes that look like a capitol dome and Reef for the fold in the Earth known as a monocline, named the Waterpocket Fold, which was a barrier to travel like a reef at sea. The Waterpocket Fold got its name for the pockets eroded in the monocline fold that hold water year round. Highlights of the visit for us were the scenic drive and the Notom-Bullfrog road which provided different perspectives of the Waterpocket Fold; our two favorite hikes, the Cassidy Arch trail and Capitol Gorge trail; the remains of Fruita with the flowering orchards during our spring visit and the Gifford Homestead with the wonderful homemade fruit pies; and, for the kids, the Junior Geology badge. If one has a high clearance 4x4 vehicle, one can visit the backcountry Cathedral Valley section with its famous monoliths and true solitude.

Raspberry Island has a historic lighthouse and a ranger gives a good tour. You can also take a short hike. Day 3: We had a pre-arranged kayak tour with Living Adventures, a local kayak tour company.

It happened to be foggy and eerie - all the better. At noon-ish, we stopped for lunch on the beach, and the guides set up a table with delicious wrap sandwiches, drinks, cookies - very tasty. Then we headed back to Myers Beach. It was a full and busy trip. Be prepared - weather can change instantly, although we traveled during a hot spell.

The battle here was much more significant and costly than many people realize, and a visit there was a great way to learn about it. The visitor's center has a nice movie, 30 minutes long, that gives great overview of the battle. Right when that ended, we were able to catch a 30-minute ranger talk up in the observation area, which really helped orient us. After that, a walk through the museum was the final way to get acquainted with the battle before going out on the self guided auto tour. I'm thinking a guided driving tour with a ranger would have been best. We've done that in Gettysburg and it's fantastic. But this time we purchased the CD for $20. A little bit steep, but considering HOW CHEAP it is to get in the center itself it was no biggie. It was only $6 for BOTH of us for three days. Insane. I almost wish they would charge more so they could maybe make some improvements. Sadly this place has not been given the attention it deserves like Gettysburg has, but I hope it does because it should. The museum could be much larger I think... Make sure to plan about three hours for the driving tour, not the 1.5 to 2 hours they recommend. We felt rushed.

Be sure to bring plenty of water and sun protection with you as the hike is approximately 6 miles in total but offers spectacular views and experiences of waling in an alien world. I would not recommend this for children. The visitors center does offer snow sled rentals that you can use to go sledding on the sand dunes. Walking though the desert and finishing our trek as the sun set behind the mountains is surely a life event not to be forgotten. (The hike is perhaps not so highly recommended at the height of summer)",

The ranger was also knowledgeable and explained how the sands formed and about the wildlife and plants. The next day we hied to the 'lake' (now dried) which is about a 5-mile round trip. Do this in the morning before it gets warm - we set off at around 8.00 am and it took a couple of hours (including taking plenty of photos). You may want to take water with you too - especially if it's hot. We also wore proper hiking boots/footwear, which helped us keep going. The visitor centre is also worth a look and we'd recommend the short film. Watch out for white lizards, which have adapted over time to be camouflaged against the surroundings.",

We hiked into the floor of the crater on the sliding sands trail and then along a side trail around one of the cinder cones. It took us over 5 hours to hike in and then back out but it was so worth it. We got there early in the day and enjoyed such amazing vistas. The clouds were rolling in as we were hiking out but that made for some amazing photos as well. It was a tough hike out as all the reviews warned it would be. But if you take your time and lots of water it is worth every step. There are some great views from the lookout but there is nothing like walking into the crater. Would love to do it again only camp inside the crater and walk out the next day ! This is a must do if you go to Maui.

We stopped for the 1/4 mile walk through the Cholla Garden and that was great. Once into the Joshua tree area it was beautiful terrain with huge boulders and hills of rocks that appeared to have been dumped there by a super being. There are plenty of places to camp and picnic (which we did) and strategically placed restrooms.

We stayed in Lahaina and while the drive was made in the dark, what beauty awaits you when you arrive 10,023 feet above sea level! We walked down into crater and anyone who takes time to drive up, really should take time to walk down into the crater. Breathtaking views when not immersed in the clouds but be patient, as they will pass and you'll be left with some the bluest sky. Must also experience the absolute silence standing and taking in the views of the barren landscape! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tour.

        "text": "My husband and I went on the ferry boat trip to The Dry Tortugas in late September as part of a Key West long weekend. At first we hesitated because of the time (early rise - all day away) and money (couple/few hundred bucks) but then we decided to go for it. We bought our tickets from the ticket office the night before and arrived on time for check in and departure. (I have been sick while deep sea fishing so I took one Dramamine one hour before travel but I probably would have been ok without it as it was a fairly calm ride.) The boat was neat, clean, and well organized. After the passengers got situated an appetizing cold breakfast buffet was set out that included bagels, cereals, juices, fruit, and coffee. The trip to The Dry Tortugas was in full sun on deck coming (and going) so sun screen and a hat was a must. We stayed on deck the whole time but inside I think there was a snorkeling how-to video (gear was provided but we brought our own) and another on the history of the island. Eventually a speck in the distance became the island. It was breathtaking how a fortress just \"appeared\" out of the blue of the ocean. The boat docked and passengers disembarked. Lunch would be served in about an hour. My husband went to snorkel and I opted for the fort tour led by a Park Ranger/ferry boat guide. The tour and tour guide were both interesting and I was quite entertained by the history and lore surrounding that massive structure. It was hot, much of the tour was in direct sunlight, and some walking and stair climbing was involved. Nothing I would call strenuous but proper clothing, footwear and sunblock would aid to your enjoyment of the outing. After the tour we returned to the boat for a lunch buffet of sandwiches, sides, and sodas. It was all nicely presented and delicious. Despite those childhood warnings we went swimming immediately after we ate - snorkeling in fact! My husband thought the best snorkeling he'd found was out to a buoy and then back along the side of the fort. We headed out to the buoy, and then snorkeled two sides of the fort (one was calm and one was a little rougher - but neither was too challenging for even a novice snorkeler). All offered great views of sea life. Thankfully NO JELLY FISH at the fort although we saw lots on the boat rides. Check the most recent reviews for daily conditions. We were concerned and got lucky. Jelly fish would have been a deal breaker for us considering the cost of the trip. When time was up we boarded the boat (roll call was taken) and enjoyed background music and an open bar serving soft drinks and reasonably priced (and tasty!) tropical concoctions and beer. We relaxed on the return trip to Key West and reflected on a fabulous day of fun in the sun on The Dry Tortugas.",

The drive is beautiful and there are a ton of places to stop and take pictures of the view and many waterfalls along the way. If you get car sick easily, be sure to make the necessary preparations, because you will get car sick. Once you arrive at the national park and have paid you $10 park admission, drive up to the main parking area and park. You can enter the gift shop and get maps and ask any questions you may have. There are 2 paths, the shorter path leads to the lower pools, and the longer path lead to the 200 foot waterfall and bamboo forest. I strongly suggest taking the longer path first. The lower pools are nice, but the other path is by far the best. Be sure to pack waters. This hike is long and considered difficult by some, so again if you have health issues, be careful. Honestly, as we got about 2/3rds of the way through, I was getting skeptical, even considered stopping. I am so thankful that we didn't. The bamboo forests was like something out of a fairy tale, and then as you walk out of the bamboo forest and continue about 75 yard, you get to see this amazing 200' waterfall. You can walk up to it and stand beneath and feel the exhilaration rain down on your head. It is simply one of the most memorable moments you will ever have. Don't pass up this opportunity. I'm sure that it will not be long before they regulate how close you can get to the bottom of the falls, and I am sure \u00fcit's just a matter of time.

Day 1 we went to the Lost Mine trail in the Chisnos Mtns and the view from the top was great that day. On the way there was actually snow in the dessert which was a rare treat from what we were told. The trail itself was easy to navigate and had a lot of switchbacks. My 9 year old daughter paced our family the entire time. The view from the top is worth the trip up. The next day we went to the Santa Elena Canyon side of the park via Jeep tour. Probably could have just as easily done this by ourselves like the other areas but wanted to try something different. If you book a jeep tour recommend you make sure that you at least get some back road travel, ours did not. Santa Elena is spectacular as well and there is a short hike back into the canyon. There were several points of interest along the way that we stopped as well. Our 3rd day we went to the Rio Grande/Boquillas area. We took the Boquillas International Ferry (heavy sarcasm but that's what they call it) to Mexico for some shopping and lunch and felt safe and enjoyed ourselves. There is plenty of evidence of illegal border crossing activity as there are many locations that have souvenirs for sale on the US side and a bucket for $ donations. We saw a couple of folks that had canoed across the Rio Grande to sing for the tourists, kind of comical and never felt threatened. There is small cave at the end of the trail that you can climb up to. Kids of all ages enjoyed. ",

We were so lucky that by the time of our trip all parks were opened and we were so much happy to visit Mt Rushmore and the Custer State park. Very impressive! We came twice to the monument, because the parking fee was valid till the end of 2013. One day it was snowy and the weather was changing from snowfall to bright sun. Another day was just sun and blue sky. Definitely, the monument looks great against the blue sky. The Presidential Trail allows you to see the faces from different points of view and the trail is not difficult at all. We also liked the Made in USA store and had very good lunch at the Presidential Cafe. Both places highly recommended. We stayed in the Holiday Inn in Keystone.",

She was not bored on the boat, they show videos of snorkeling, etc. and point things out along the way. We were lucky to have a gorgeous day. The weather plays a big role in this trip. If you have a bad day, it might not be as much fun. We toured the fort, snorkeled swam, walked the moat and looked at fish 0- basically just explored. It's amazing. I totally forgot to look at the birds! Even brough binoculars, but I was so blown away by the fish I forgot!!! The crew on the yankee freedome was great. Food was perfect. I was a little put off by the crew at the end of the trip standing at the exit with a tip bucket. It just rubbed me the wrong way since I just paid over $200 for the trip. I would not have minded tipping, but I didn't like the feeling of being shamed into it by them holding a bucket and staring at me. That really bothered me. I would tell anyone to do this trip, but maybe book it once you know the weather - this trip will go even if the weather is bad and sea is rough so you might want to make sure it's going to be a decent day. Don't forget a towel and water shoes - it can be rocky in the water. Most important, bring your camera!!!!",

Our guide was Kate who was very interesting and really knew all about the cave. This tour does have a lot of stairs but it's not strenuous. Since we were there in December, we were the only ones on the tour. I really like visiting National Parks during the winter months. They are less crowded and the rangers are more laid back without large crowds to deal with. Being winter, the 49 degrees in the cave was about the same temperature as outside.

Take note the ticket booth doesn't give change for your park pass so have the $10 per car. Once at the top we stopped at the crater lookout.....that is a sight in itself looking over into that vast area with all the changes in colors.. Wow. We arrived at the summit lookout about 45 min from sunset.. Took a look around at the observation area with all the great information, It was cold and windy but we were prepared and dressed for the occasion, Our biggest laugh of the day was seeing everyone wrapped in the striped hotel towels and even one lady in a bedspread. Not everyone reads trip advisor before taking this trip I guess :). As the sun went down I realized that the observatory that is at the summit (not open to public) sits directly in front of where the sunset would take place so after a few photos and some deliberation we decided our best view would be a little down the mountain at one of the lookouts so that's what we did and it was amazing, the view of sunset was stunning. We stopped at a couple different places and even made it out of the park area before dark. Maybe the sun sets a bit farther north so the observatory isn't always in the way but in December it sure was. I'm glad we chose to descend for some shots, This was worth the drive and even if you aren't keen on sunrise do this instead, Equally amazing!",

The two areas however, are not connected so will likely require too different days to explore. The summit is great to see the variety of climates/scenery on Maui. It changes dramatically green pastures to panoramas that are more reminiscent of a martian landscape. I would recommend taking some time to explore the sliding sands trail that starts from the upper visitors center. It was amazing! On the Kipahulu coast, definitely take the Pipiwai trail up to see the Waimoku falls and the bamboo forest. This was also a must do in Maui. Once you get down from the hike, take a short hike to the O'heo gulch and cool off and go swimming in the freshwater pools fed by small series of waterfalls. The park has a lot to offer, definitely check it out! Oh, and save your entry receipt because the $10 entry gets you into both sections on different days.",

The road to and from has a lot of curves, so if you don\u2019t like to drive curvy roads in the dark (coming back) I wouldn\u2019t do it. We had no problems and still spent 6-7 hours in the park. Make sure you fill up the car before you leave, gas is limited and costly on this road. There is a $10 per car entrance fee into VNP, but we thought it was well worth the money paid. The park is laid out very well and the visitor center is a must stop. The park rangers were very helpful and shared the important places to visit. Here are the stops we made: Visitor Center, Volcano House, Jagger Museum, Steam vents, Thurston Lava Tube, Chain of Craters Road, ending our tour at the Jagger Museum. Plenty of stops along the way to take pictures of the beautiful scenery. The two highlights for us were the walk at the end of chain of craters road (over the lava flow) and the night-time viewing of Kilauea Crater (glowing red lava). While it was a fairly long day (11 hours) from the time we left Kona until we returned it was well worth the trip. Note: we also stopped at South Point and Punaluu County Beach Park (a black sand beach) on the way to VNP, so if you didn\u2019t do that it would only be about 9.5 hours.",

Discovered in the early 1900s by the Michaud brothers who tried to make this a tourist attraction, Jewel Cave was a commercial flop. It became part of the Park Service. Today only a portion of the cave has been explored. In order to see the cave you must take a tour. There are various tours of different lengths and abilities. The only one available to us when we went was the shortest tour and it was free if you had a park pass. The guide took us by elevator down about 240 feet where we entered a large cavern lit with electric lights. It had intricate formations that we could see from the large metal platform we were standing on. The guide told us about the cave and the formations and that was the tour. Then we took the elevator up again. Katherine, our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly, and answered all our questions. The only thing I would do differently is get there earlier and take a longer tour. ",

As if I already knew where to go, I pulled onto a gravel road 10 minutes south of 40 and ended up on the bluffs. When I'm here I feel completely at peace. This place feels absolutely sacred, especially since many people don't know it exists. It is very quiet and out of three visits (2 during the peak of tourist season) I have never encountered a living soul. Walked right along the edge of the towering cliffs with my dog, neither of us concerned with worldly distractions. Last time we stopped it was snowing and the desert was covering with a light dusting - just enough to add to the desert's beauty without completely masking the land. The clouds cleared quickly to expose the mountains within them, like billowing smoke below a baby blue sky. This is where I go to rediscover myself and clear my head of all stresses.

We were here on a sunny day right after days of rain so they were really letting off steam! We went to jagger museum and saw the Kilauea crater which was fantastic, didn't see any lava but saw plenty of smoke. It would be amazing to be here at night as it has a red glow to the volcano. The road from jagger museum to the other side of the crater was closed due to volcanic activity. We then went to the thurston lava tube I was hesitant about going in these lava tubes as I thought it may be claustrophobic but it was fine! The tube could fit a large car inside them and it was well lit up and an amazing feeling. We drove past and stopped at a few pit craters and drove down to the 2003 lava that blocked the road off near the ocean lava was everywhere it was incredible too see!! We spent 4.5 hours in the park and I think that's the absolute minimum time you should spend here to really enjoy everything. It is a $10 fee to enter per car valid for 7 days that goes toward improving the park. One tip is they have a few places to get a beverage but not anywhere to eat we were starving when we left so bring some snacks at minimum! ",

The skies were threatening, with rain afar, and we got some awesome pictures of rainbows. The next day we visited Frutia, a restored Mormon settlement, very near Rt. 12. Get there early to have a selection of the homemade pie. You can pick apples, on the honor-system for payment, in the orchards that are still maintained there. There is also a hike that starts there, following the Fremont River. Frutia gives you a feeling of peace; it\u2019s very peaceful there. A short distance east of Frutia on Rt. 12 we visited the petroglyphs and the School House. We got lucky and joined a Ranger-led group and saw petroglyphs we otherwise may have missed. The Scenic Drive is a 16-mile round trip drive that goes south from Frutia and it is breathtakingly beautiful! The second night we returned to Panorama Point (we were the only ones left at nightfall, a bit spooky) to view the stars.

There is a little museum with a interesting movie about the history of the Golden Spike. We all really enjoyed ourselves, all the employees were very friendly and informative.

It's a fair drive away, but we drove along the North shore and stopped at multiple breathtaking waterfalls, and a botanical garden along the way. I recommend leaving at daybreak, as you'll need all the time you can get, and will definitely return after dark. Also, make sure you have LOTS of film/space on your memory card. There is an entrance fee to get into the park, but it is relative to the experience. There is so much to see onsite, lots of wildlife as well! The lava tunnel was very interesting, but not good if you're claustrophobic, and the steam vent was neat to experience as well. Part of the park was closed down while I was there due to toxic fumes coming up from the earth. It was very cool to see the craters, and the lava flow, where it had solidified over time. There are placards all over the place with a lot of info to keep you informed. Dining and bathroom facilities onsite, as well as gift shops, but all very overpriced. You cannot actually SEE the active lava flow in the National park, which is a bit of a disappointment if you weren't aware previously, but we spoke with our concierge before leaving Kona. He told us about a road located about a half hour up the road, backtracking toward Hilo. **You MUST do this after dark, or it is pointless, so go to this after the National Park** You drive down this road for approximately 25 mins, and it feels as though you are driving into the middle of nowhere. The road cuts off into what is basically a dirt path into the jungle, but don't panic! It's not the developing horror story that it feels like. At the end of the dirt road there is a field in which you can park and walk up to a small makeshift market. The market has coconuts for sale, as well as lava photos and other items. On the other side of the market a path leads over hardened lava flow, which is difficult to navigate, so be very cautious, even though it is well marked. You must bring your own flashlight with you, and I recommend one per person as it's pitch black. try to purchase your flashlight at a wal-mart in Hilo or Kona, as they are available onsite, but with an extreme markup. The path over the lava opens onto an open area where you can see the active lava in the distance popping and splashing up. This is the closest you can get to active lava flows without hiring a helicopter or a boat tour to take you, and there is no entrance fee. I would speak with your concierge about it so they can give you clear directions on a map. This part of my day trip was definitely an unexpected highlight, but the actual National park is worth every second of the daylight hours you have!",

There is only one ferry boat that goes out there. It's a nice ride and they serve breakfast and lunch as part of the price, and also provide snorkeling equipment. It sounded pretty interesting so we splurged on a day at the Tortugas. Unfortunately, you can't count on the weather. So although it warm and sunny, winds had kicked up the surf pretty hard from mid-day on. Some snorkeling areas were rough for swimming and in others the waters were obscured with all the sand kicked up by wave action. And on the two-hour trip back, the sea got quite rough with several people getting very sea-sick. The ship's crew were very helpful, but overall I'm not sure the day was worth the $320 we paid for the two of us. ",

We found it to be quite unique - huge one-of-a-kind rock formations, that draw lots of climbers, and vegetation that is unique to the area. Since I recently had knee surgery, we didn't do any hiking, just mostly stuck to the main roads for sightseeing from the car. It is a hiker's paradise though. Got a pretty good look at the San Andreas fault from one of the high vantage points. Make sure you take food and water with you as there's no food for purchase in the park. One word of advice - if you've come in at the West gate, probably best to go back out the west gate when you want to leave. My husband decided to go all the way out to the east end, and the road is torturously winding and curvy (much worse than the Road to Hana!) Note that there is a $15 fee per car to enter the park.",

Our original goal in visiting was to see the Condors with their 25 foot wingspans. We saw 3 on our first trip, and at least 7 on our second trip, (three of the 7 sightings were for the same bird). We went into the park through the West entrance near Soledad. The 20 mile trip is on a curvy road that is frequently one lane wide, but we had no problem at all. There were plenty of spots to pull over to allow the little bit of oncoming traffic to pass. We used the Balconies loop trail which is rated as moderate, and goes through a cave. We picked up flashlights on the way. However, once we got to the park, several other middle-age couples told us that the cave is not as easy to get through as the brochure states, and they recommended head lamps and an ability to do a little climbing in the dark. We decided to hike the trail to the cave entrance, and when we saw the size of the large boulders just inside the cave, we knew that for us, we had made the right decision. The parking lot for the trail has restrooms and a picnic area. The path is well-maintained dirt, with short wooden bridges over the stream beds that normally would have water in them. The rock formations looming overhead are beautiful, and everywhere we turned was unique and scenic. The path has some ups and downs, but they were fairy easy to negotiate and not steep. On our second visit, we chose to follow the loop up to the Balconies and head towards the other cave entrance. This path climbed up through the boulders, but was never steep. The switchbacks in the trail made for a pleasant climb both up and down, with no section that left us panting for breath. When we got to the highest point on the trail, ( about 1 mile from the parking lot) we stopped for lunch and looked over into the next canyon. Several groups passed us that completed the loop through the cave, not all of them were young and super-fit, and they said they had no problem with the cave. One group even had a little one in a backpack. I highly recommend taking time to visit Pinnacles and hike this short, fairly easy trail to experience the beauty of the canyon, the chaparral and the rock formations. The condors and many other birds living in the park are an extra bonus. We saw several types of jays, titmice, sparrows, wrens and the acorn woodpecker, as well as a road-runner crossing the road. For the more intrepid, there are numerous climbing walls maintained in the park, and several long trails - we did not use these.",

Although the weather was not warm, it was not humid either, and there were no mosquitos to ruin our day. Once we arrived, we decided to take the Boardwalk Trail, which was not too long for our 7 year old son. The mangroves were amazing, the water was beautiful, and we even saw wildlife! Much to our excitement, we saw feral hogs, which are basically wild pigs. In addition, we saw turtles, birds, squirrels, and a pileated woodpecker. We have been to hundreds of national parks around the country, and I would definitely rate this one in the top 3.

The history of this fort is quite interesting and worth greater research upon returning to the mainland. . While the fish did not cooperate by joining us while we were snorkeling, the beautiful water and the opportunity to snorkel in the shadow of Fort Jefferson was outstanding. Recommend taking some drinking water with you before you leave Key West as there are no water fountains on the island. And, while there are no restroom facilities on the island, the Yankee Freedom is but a stones throw from the fort and has ample restroom facilities. Lots of walking involved, as well as stairs if one wants to get the full appreciation of Fort Jefferson. Likely not a great trip for children as well as folks who might get sea sick.

I read several other reviews of cave attractions in the area (the zip line one), but thought it would be better to give my dollars to the National Parks. I was glad I did. You don't have to pay an entry fee to get in the park which was a pleasant surprise. You also don't have to pay to park, so you can spend the day in the park for no money at all. The only thing that I saw you have to pay to enjoy are the cave tours, a back country permit or the on site hotel. The facility here is beautiful. I heard the ranger say it was three years old. There are indoor bathrooms, a very small gift shop and plenty of hiking trails and shelters to picnic. I made my reservation for the \"historic\" tour online a week ahead of time. When I arrived, the helpful ranger pulled up my reservation and I had my ticket with no problems at all. In the two hours before my tour started, I was able to hike a few of the trails. It was a beautiful, unusually mild February day. I'm not an avid hiker and didn't come prepared to hike. I just had water, a jacket and tennis shoes. I did fine on the main trails around the visitor center. The trail to the river was a challenge on the way up the hill for me, but a good workout. The historic cave tour itself started with warnings about health, claustrophobia and minding your children. All three warnings were for good reason. There were about 4-5 areas of the tour where at 5' 3\", I had to crouch. Tall people, be warned. There was also an area of the tour (\"Fat Man's Misery\") where you shimmy and squeeze between these natural rock formations about 4 feet tall. The guide said the gaps are 18\" wide. This was one of the highlights for me. I felt like a giant making my way through the grand canyon! Large people, claustrophobic people, special needs people, be warned. The final highlight of the tour for me was winding up several hundred stairs to get back to ground level and seeing the beautiful waterfall that had formed due to melting snow and ice. This was a challenging stairway hike, but doable for average people. I was in the front of the group just behind the guide- which I recommend for anyone not wanting to have the experience of running to catch up, listening to everyone's chatter or children and hearing the impromptu comments from the guide. The overall experience could have been better. The tour guide was a colorful Kentucky fellow really uptight about camera flashes (which I didn't mind). The tour experience depended on listening to his rendition of the cave's highlights. There were no signs anywhere in the cave- which could have provided more information. There were areas at the beginning of the cave that were poorly lit where people banged into each other. I felt this was a bigger safety hazard than a wayward camera flash. The tour was light on interesting history and facts, but still interesting. Improved lighting, some signage and more historical or geological facts would have made this a 4 or 5 star place, Definitely a worthwhile stop. A true bargain at $12 for a 2 hour experience.",

The snorkeling is great, go to the area where the old pier use to be located, saw the largest mangrove snappers I have ever seen. The food provided by the fish is very good and everything is clean and well organized. Before you leave visit the store in the fort get presents for grandchildren. ",

        "text": "This unique National Park is an easy day trip from the Palm Springs/Palm Desert area. There are 3 entrances; northwest, north, and south. We entered at the northwest entrance, picked up maps and a pass at the user friendly visitor center (The rangers there are very knowledgeable about hikes, driving times, etc.) and completed two fabulous hikes. I highly recommend the Ryan Mountain hike. It's a great workout, but not overly strenuous. The scenery is absolutely spectacular, and you will be rewarded with a 360 degree view of the park when you reach the top. You start by hiking around skyscraper sized boulders and then continue up with the view and scenery getting better and better. I was waiting for John Wayne to ride up. Be forewarned: While it may be balmy and pleasant at the foot of the mountain, the weather at the top can be cold and windy (depending on the time of year). Bring plenty of warm clothing that you can layer, and don't forget a warm hat and gloves. We followed this hike with an easy, but very scenic 1 mile hike in Hidden Valley....also highly recommended (and great for kids or non-hikers). Imagine entering a valley surrounded on all sides by huge boulders. You'll think you're in an episode of the Flintstones! Excellent signage along this trail will educate you about the geology and plants. Both of these hikes can be done in a day trip to the park. ",

A nutritious breakfast is served on the main deck, food that is included in the rather expensive cost of the tour. After reaching Fort Jefferson and spending an hour or so on either a guided tour staffed by one of the knowledgeable employees, a filling nutritious lunch is served, again on the main deck. Again, there is no additional charge for either the tour or the lunch. The visitors on board then are able to get snorkeling gear, again without charge, to enjoy a delightful undersea tour with all sorts of denizens at a private beach.

What a rush!!!! it's the closest you will get to flying as a bird. You will see islands, sharks, stingrays, turtles, sunken ships, even boats left in the water by refugees trying to reach the US soils. The park was fun, we've seen many forts, but it was ok. The beach amazing a little cold but it's February and freezing in the east cost, the water was in the low 70\"s, many people snorkeled we went up to our knees. We took the two o'clock tour and it was great because the ferry leaves when we arrive so we had the island to ourselves. The only negative is that their no water, the tour included a cooler with water each guest had their own cooler but their is no running water to clean up after your swim. You are in the middle of nowhere and it felt amazing. Great Experience, I wish more people would take this adventure.",

I did a little research on the internet beforehand as I was just looking for something in the moderate range with some nice views and solitude. This hike fit perfectly for what I was looking for. About 6 miles round trip with about 1000' elevation gain. Nice views from the top of Warren Peak. I saw a couple of other hikers at the beginning of the trail but no one after about the first mile or so all the way to the top and back down. I spent about an hour at the peak just relaxing and enjoying the view and solitude. The hike is very exposed to the sun so be prepared. I took a couple of 32 oz bottles of Gatorade and drank both. It also follows a sandy wash most of the way so its slow walking. It was sunny and low 80's when I did it. I wouldn't want to do this when it was very much warmer.

It was a great trip to get us out of Key West for the day. The boat ride didn't seem that long to us. The crew was very friendly and helpful and the boat made the ride very smooth even though the water seemed choppy. Breakfast and lunch was included, which was nice not to have to pay Key West prices for the day. If you are into history, the story of the fort was interesting. The snorkeling was disappointing. Not a huge variety of fish or color, but we did see a huge hermit crab. There were cocktails for sale on the way back, which also made the boat ride go by fast.",

We arrived in the winter so many things were not open such as the theater but we still had to pay $11 for parking.

Be sure to have a good set (my cheap ones didn't even make it out of the parking lot) of strap-on crampons/cleats for your boots. They really help when walking on the ice or on the packed down snow. They are more a safety factor ( I can attest to this) than you might think. Also, ski or trekking poles are also helpful.

The visitor center has some good information but the movie wasn't running when we were there so we felt we missed a bit of additional knowledge. We got a brochure and took the four miles of winding roads to the top. From there it's about 600' walk up to the pinnacle. At that point you are seeing Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee. Looking down you can see the gap. The use of that pass in the 1800s must have been an extreme adventure. You really wanted to get on the other side. There wasn't much more to it than that.

There are guided tours of the fort, or you can tour at your own leisure, the fort is in the process of being restored, so there are areas that the public has no access to, but don't worry, there is plenty of area to explore, including walking the mote wall around the outside of the fort. There are three levels of the walls to walk, observe the restored 25 ton canons, enjoy the view from the top level, stair wells are in the corners of the fort. Over night camping is also permitted, so bring a tent, if that's your fancy. There is a small gift store to purchase souvenirs on the property. On the return trip, all names of passengers are accounted for before the ferry leaves, and the bar is open for those passengers who are over 21 years of age, and have the cash to purchase beer, wine, and mixed drinks. The crew was very friendly, and informative. This is a must see tour for all ages, and I highly recommend it.",

After our trip to Fort Jefferson/Dry Tortugas aboard the Yankee Trader, we got answers and had a fantastic time. In a nutshell: The Dry Tortugas are tiny islands that are part of the Keys and are even further away from the mainland than Key West. The main attraction is Fort Jefferson (where the ferry anchors) which totally encompasses one of the islands, leaving only a narrow swath of white sand beaches around the perimeter. The water is the clearest and warmest that I ever seen. Swimming and snorkeling were out of this world. You can camp there overnight if you go through a lot of trouble\u2026but it's probably worth it. It's not cheap. Only one ferry boat goes out once a day. But go. It's one of those adventures that you need to take on. We ordered up our expensive ferry tickets on line to save a bit of money. Breakfast and lunch are served on board the ship and the food is fine.The snorkeling instructions and equipment are included, as is the entrance to the fort (since we hold National Park Passes, we had that amount deducted from the total charge). FYI: you can only buy Dry Tortugas t-shirts at the gift store inside the fort,so you might want to think about picking some up. Another FYI: Since my husband and I were unwilling to leave the water, we almost missed out on the lunch buffet :-(",

Unfortunately this made many people sick. The crew was constantly taking care of the little white barf bags, I think those guys are paid by the pound! Seriously, I didn't find it bad but after two hours I realized why I don't spend a lot of time on the water. Ft. Jefferson was fantastic. Our guide gave us a great talk with lots of historic information. We didn't snorkel but many others did and loved it. Several people fished and ocean kayaked. Several we're camping and we picked up a few campers who were returning to Key West. Breakfast and lunch was served on the boat. ",

I highly recommend trying out the elevator at least once, although it does not work as it did back in the davit is still pretty cool. This Bath House has been restored to it's former glory and gives you a glance into the past. I loved this House you can see all the equipment they used, the baths themselves, changing rooms with actual clothing in them, courtyards, music room and even hotel like guest rooms, it is fantastic. A few steps away from that house you will find another 2 Houses that are actual Bath Houses although they are a bit modernized inside you still get the idea and maybe can indulge in a Hot Bath yourself. There is one that is used as a gift shop and you can get your National Park Passport stamped there. I loved this place and regret not partaking in a Bath, oh well maybe next time. FYI the cheapest Bath is $30 at one of the Bath Houses which is pretty economical.

Late in the day, the place was nearly deserted and we almost felt like we didn't belong there. Nearing dusk, we were the only car in the Montezuma Pass parking lot other than the Border Patrol surveillance vehicle. Since we are from the northeast, we found the Border Patrol & warning signs to be an interesting diversion. From the top, one can see a great vista and a perspective on the fence. On the way down we saw a wren working the rocks and would like to have spent time watching him but switchback traffic, if a vehicle should come along, would have made that dangerous.

        "text": "This not NOT an inexpensive trip. Or a short one. You'll need to buy a small plane ticket, or have your own (not small) boat, or hop on the Yankee Freedom ferry. The plane is quick, a boat is slow, and the Yankee Freedom hauls butt at 27.5 knots...and STILL takes almost 2 1/2 hours to get there! It's Dry Tortugas is 70 miles west of Key West. It's OUT THERE. We took the ferry, with is about $170 for each of us. For that you get the ride out and back, some information, breakfast and lunch and snorkel gear if you want it. There's a pay bar for the ride back. The folks on the boat did a good job. Once you get there you can snorkel (it's pretty good if you go to the reef), just OK at the moat wall...although we did see a monster (six foot?) ray parked on the bottom in the sand. Cool! And/or you can explore the fort. It's a BIG fort with three levels, a lot of acreage and a lot to see. There is great signage that walks you through life at the fort and facets of the fort itself. We took our time and it took us about two hours to do it all. Well worth it. You have 3 1/2 hours on the island, so fitting in snorkeling and lunch and exploring will keep you hopping. Note: There are guided tours of the fort.l They are very good. OR you can get a self-guided book tour with is also very good, especially when combined with the signage. Note 2: Take some water with you when you're exploring the fort. They call it DRY Tortugas for a reason. Note 3: Best snorkeling is the coral reef west of the fort, about 200' from the moat wall. The next best snorkeling is among the pilings of the old wharfs. Note 4: If you want to sit in the open air on the way out to the island, go straight up top. Those seats fill up fast. They serve you breakfast and if you get it and eat it on the main indoor deck you 'll be stuck there for two hours. Grab food and head topside OR leave your partner up top and go down and one of you get breakfast for both of you. You'll likely finish it before the boat gets very far and you're set!",

I booked an afternoon tour but we ended up arriving in the morning. It was $3 per ticket to change tickets to a morning tour so be aware of that. Realistically this was a tour offered many times a day and it was a Tuesday in the off season so it probably did not make sense to book online ahead of time unless it is a tour that is only offered a few times per day. There were 26 in our tour and Jerry our guide said he had as many as 125. After meeting at Shelter B, a bus took us to the entrance and we started our descent. There are lockers at the shelter where you can leave a backpack or purse but it is just as easy to leave it in your trunk. Our guide was from that area and had a rich family history which made the tour even more special. My boys 10 and 14 loved this tour. They enjoyed squeezing and ducking through the cave walls as we made our way down the stairs. After the bus brought us back to the Visitor Center, we had lunch in the restaurant. The choices were limited but it was reasonability priced and quickly prepared. We hiked around the Visitor Center when we were done before leaving for our next stop. There are tons of hiking and biking trails in the area so you definitely could spend an entire day or two taking in the area. The Visitor Center is well done too and interesting to read about the history of the cave. Don\u2019t forget to stamp your National Passport books in the gift shop. The 1991 stamp set has Mammoth Cave stamp on it. Both sons said \u201c5 \u00bd stars\u201d when we were leaving the park.",

It rained the day before our trip, but the waters looked clear and amazing from the boat. We were fitted with good quality snorkel gear and headed to the north beach. It's safe to just claim a beach spot and leave your belongings for the day, as you come and go from the fort and in and out of the water. Unfortunately, we should have waited one more day because once in the beautiful blue water the visibility underneath was murky. It was disappointing; however, we ventured on and snorkeled for several hours, just making the best of it, but knowing we were missing out on seeing the beautiful fish beneath us. They serve an awesome big lunch early enough for everyone's stomach to settle before heading back on the 2 hour boat ride.

Comparing how he lived to how we live today is just mind blowing. His office was just a desk in the corner of the family room, his family room had a couple chairs by the fireplace, the exact spot where Republicans offered him the Presidency. The upstairs is 5 bedrooms almost all connected. Just a great time and pictures are allowed.",

It's not free, but if you're over 62, disabled, or in the military, you get a free or discounted lifetime pass that also gets in 2 guests for free- so read the signs carefully! There's a lot to explore here. It's equally interesting for adults and young children. For the kids, they have an activity book that gets them a ranger badge after it's all filled out. There are soldiers dressed in period costume that let off cannons, take pictures, sign autographs, and do presentations about the fort every so often. If you're interested in history at all, I would definitely visit this place!",

Those with claustrophobia should avoid this tour. The history of mans use of this cave is interesting and our guide did an outstanding job of presenting in an entertaining and informative fashion.
